## Mission
Extract hard financial data from the most recent Quarterly Results (Earnings Release) and Management Guidance.

## Research Objectives
Locate the specific numbers for the last reported quarter vs. the same quarter last year (YoY):
1.  **Top Line**: Net Revenue (Receita Líquida).
2.  **Operational**: EBITDA (Adjusted) and EBITDA Margin.
3.  **Bottom Line**: Net Income (Lucro Líquido) and Net Margin.
4.  **Cash Flow**: Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow.
5.  **Guidance**: Specific targets provided by management for the full year (Production, Capex, Costs).

## Output Requirements (STRICT)
-   **Format**: A raw data log.
-   **Precision**: Use exact numbers (e.g., "R$ 4.2 billion", not "billions").
-   **Comparison**: Explicitly state the % growth or decline if available.
-   **Context**: Mention *why* the numbers changed (e.g., "Revenue fell due to 10% drop in volume").

**Output ONLY the financial data log.**
