## 📝 Detailed Summary
GARE11 exhibits a mixed performance profile. Recent acquisitions, including Parque Logístico de Confins (yield >10% for 60 months) and a corporate building in Belo Horizonte (10.7% cap rate for 5 years), signal positive growth. The fund declared a dividend of R$0.08 per share (11.34% annual yield, ex-dividend date Jan 2, 2026). However, the sale of 10 properties leased to Grupo Pão de Açúcar and Grupo Matheus introduces uncertainty. The completion of the 7th issuance (141.7 million shares at R$9.00 on January 14, 2026) may dilute existing shareholders.
