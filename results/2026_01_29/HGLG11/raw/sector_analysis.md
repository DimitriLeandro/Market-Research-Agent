Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Logistics sector in Brazil, focusing on the specified drivers and adhering to the format and constraints.

Here's an analysis of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Logistics sector in Brazil, based on the provided research objectives:

### 1. Commodity/Input Prices:

*   **Iron Ore:** On January 29, 2026, Iron Ore was priced at $105.77 USD/T. Over the past year, the price has increased by 4.38%.
*   **Brent Oil:** On January 27, 2026, Brent Crude futures closed at US$65.59 a barrel. The EIA projects Brent Crude prices to decline to $55.87 per barrel in 2026 and $54.02 per barrel in 2027.
*   **Pulp Prices:** Kraft Pulp was priced at 5352 CNY/T on January 29, 2026. This represents a 13.12% decrease compared to the same time last year. In 2023, the average mechanical wood pulp export price from Brazil was $575 per ton, a 6.5% decrease compared to the previous year.
*   **CBIOs (Brazilian Decarbonization Credits):** In October 2024, CBIO prices rose to R$91 ($16), a 17% increase over two weeks, reaching the highest level since May. On January 28, 2026, CBIOs were trading around R$29.50.

### 2. Interest Rates & Inflation:

*   **Selic Rate:** As of January 28, 2026, the Central Bank of Brazil (COPOM) maintained the Selic rate at 15.00% per year. The Central Bank is expected to begin cutting rates again in March.
*   **IPCA (Inflation):** The 12-month cumulative IPCA closed 2025 at 4.26%. In July 2024, the IPCA saw an increase of 0.38%, marking a 12-month high of 4.50%. The IPCA for transport was reported at 6,992.530 Dec1993=100 in Dec 2025.
*   **Impact:** High interest rates are seen as an obstacle to short-term credit for 80% of industrial companies. A high Selic rate makes real estate credit more expensive and inhibits new projects.

### 3. Regulatory Actions:

*   **Central Bank of Brazil:** In November 2025, the Central Bank issued resolutions (BCB Nos. 519, 520, and 521) establishing a regulatory framework for virtual asset services. On September 5, 2025, the Brazilian Central Bank (BCB) issued a series of measures to strengthen the safety of the country's National Financial System.
*   **ANP (National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels):** A possible decision by Brazil's hydrocarbon regulator ANP to consider the accumulated volume of non-retired certificates in penalties against distributors could lead to higher CBIO prices.
*   **ANS (Brazilian National Agency for Supplementary Health):** As of January 8, 2026, several new and revised standards are in development, including ANS-2.32-202x regarding remediation of radioactive contamination and ANS-2.34-202x concerning characterization of volcanic hazards.
*   **ANEEL (National Electric Energy Agency):** In October 2025, electricity price growth eased to 3.1% after the National Electric Energy Agency reduced the red flag level.

### 4. Global Correlation:

*   **China:** China's economic activity and trade policies can affect commodity prices, such as iron ore.
*   **US Federal Reserve:** When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, US assets become more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real.
*   **US Tariffs:** The US has imposed tariffs on Brazil, which has disrupted trade logistics. The US drops tariff threat on European countries.
*   **US Economic Conditions:** US economic conditions and global financial volatility continue to affect emerging markets.
*   **Geopolitical Tensions:** Geopolitical tensions involving the U.S. can influence the search for “safe-haven” assets, impacting the Brazilian real.
