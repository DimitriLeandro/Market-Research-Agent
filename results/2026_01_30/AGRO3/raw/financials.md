Financial Data Log for AGRO3:

1.  **Top Line:**

3.  **Bottom Line:**
    *   Net Income (Lucro Líquido): Net loss of R$ 64.3 million.
    *   Net Margin: -22%, indicating a swing to net loss. The net loss was mainly due to non-cash effects from mark-to-market on receivables and assets.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Lower sugarcane productivity and sugar content, due to adverse weather and ice events, negatively impacted results and costs.
*   Operational diversification (soy, corn, cotton, cattle) helped offset some sector volatility and asset sales contributed to liquidity.
*   The company secured favorable fertilizer and input costs, aiding contribution margins despite commodity volatility.
