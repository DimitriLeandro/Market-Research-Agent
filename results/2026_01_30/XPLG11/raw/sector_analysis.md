Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Logistics sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers impacting the Logistics sector in Brazil:

*   **Commodity/Input Prices:**
    *   **Iron Ore:** In November 2025, Brazil exported $2.55B of Iron Ore. The price of Iron Ore increased to $97.84 USD/T, the highest since May 2025. Over the past year, Iron Ore decreased 10.36%.
    *   **Brent Oil:** On January 30, 2026, Brent Crude Oil fell to $69.23 USD/Bbl, a 0.52% decrease from the previous day. Over the past month, Brent's price has risen 13.77%, but it is still 8.51% lower than a year ago. The EIA projects Brent Crude prices to decline from $69.04 per barrel in 2025 to $55.87 per barrel in 2026.
    *   **Pulp:** Pulp prices in Latin America plummeted by 18%. Kraft Pulp was at 5352 CNY/T on January 29, 2026, a 0.72% increase from the previous day. Over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 2.73%, and is down 13.12% compared to the same time last year. Wood costs for pulpmills in Brazil steadily increased across 2022 and 2023.
    *   **CBIOs:** The average CBIO price was R$59.30 ($10.70) on May 13, 2025, the lowest since September 2022. By June 12, 2025, the price had slightly recovered to R$59.50.

*   **Interest Rates & Inflation:**
    *   **Selic Rate:** On January 29, 2026, Brazil's Central Bank maintained the Selic rate at 15% per year. The Central Bank signaled it may begin to reduce interest rates at the March meeting, provided inflation remains under control.
    *   **IPCA:** In 2025, Brazil's inflation, as measured by the IPCA, stood at 4.26%, the lowest annual level since 2018.

*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   **ANEEL:** In September 2024, ANEEL postponed regulatory adjustments for storage systems until 2025.
    *   **Tariffs:** In April 2025, an executive order eliminated de minimis treatment for some imports from China and Hong Kong, starting May 2, 2025.
    *   **ANP:** A possible decision by Brazil's hydrocarbon regulator ANP to consider the accumulated volume of non-retired certificates in penalties against distributors could lead to higher Cbio prices.

*   **Global Correlation:**
    *   **China:** In April 2025, an executive order eliminated de minimis treatment for some imports from China and Hong Kong, starting May 2, 2025.
    *   **US Fed Rates:** Expectations of steady U.S. interest rates, combined with the possibility of signaling a prolonged pause in rate cuts, are likely to sustain Treasury yields and favor the dollar globally.
    *   **US Tariffs:** As of January 29, 2026, J.P. Morgan Global Research is monitoring the impact of President Trump's tariff proposals. In July 2025, President Trump imposed 50% tariffs on Brazil.
