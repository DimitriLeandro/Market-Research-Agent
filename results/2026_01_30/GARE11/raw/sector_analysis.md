**Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **Selic Rate:** The Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to keep the Selic rate at 15.00% per year during its meeting next Wednesday (January 28, 2026). High interest rates are seen as a major obstacle to short-term credit by 80% of industrial companies.
*   **IPCA (Inflation):** The 12-month cumulative IPCA rate closed 2025 at 4.26%, marking the second consecutive month within the tolerance bands.

**Regulatory Actions:**

*   **ANEEL:** No specific recent regulatory changes by ANEEL directly impacting the logistics sector were found in the search results.
*   **ANP:** On December 29, 2025, ANP approved a revised natural gas tariff regime, clarifying capacity contracting rules and establishing a stable pricing mechanism for entry-exit transport operators. ANP updated the methodology for calculating the WACC for the next regulatory cycle, which will govern returns on regulated investments from 2026 to 2030.
*   **ANS:** No specific recent regulatory changes by ANS directly impacting the logistics sector were found in the search results.
*   **Central Bank:** On November 10, 2025, the Central Bank of Brazil issued three resolutions (BCB Nos. 519, 520 and 521) establishing a regulatory framework for virtual asset services, effective February 2, 2026. On January 9, 2026, the Central Bank updated minimum regulatory capital requirements for financial institutions, with a transition period from July 1, 2026, through December 31, 2027.
*   **Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change:** On January 5, 2026, Ordinances GM/MMA No. 1,560 and No. 1,561 updated reverse logistics systems for electronic products and packaging, including new materials like paper, cardboard, metals, and glass.
*   **Railway Concessions:** The Ministry of Transport plans eight railway auctions in 2026, potentially attracting R$ 140 billion in private investment.

**Global Correlation:**

*   **China:** Chinese companies invested approximately US$2.2 billion in projects in Brazil in the first six months of 2025, a 5% increase compared to the same period the previous year. CM Ports, a Chinese state-owned company, is investing significantly in expanding the terminal in Paranaguá.
*   **US Fed Rates:** Expectations of steady U.S. interest rates are likely to sustain Treasury yields and favor the dollar globally. Increased U.S. involvement in external disputes has heightened perceptions of political instability, driving a flight from U.S. assets and favoring currencies with higher interest rate differentials, such as the real.
*   **US Tariffs:** In August 2025, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on Brazilian products.
