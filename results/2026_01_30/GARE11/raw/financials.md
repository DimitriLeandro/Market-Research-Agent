Okay, I will extract the requested financial data for GARE11 from its most recent quarterly results and management guidance, focusing on the specified metrics and comparisons.

Based on the search results, it's challenging to extract the specific, hard financial data for GARE11's most recent quarter versus the same quarter last year (YoY) as requested. Many sources provide general information, dividend yields, market analysis, or news articles about asset sales and strategic changes. I am unable to locate a recent earnings release or management guidance document that contains the detailed figures needed for:

1.  Net Revenue (Receita Líquida)
2.  EBITDA (Adjusted) and EBITDA Margin
3.  Net Income (Lucro Líquido) and Net Margin
4.  Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow
5.  Specific full-year targets from management

However, I can provide some general data points found in the search results:

*   **Current Dividend Yield:** Approximately 11.3%.
*   **Market Cap:** Approximately R$ 2.5 billion.
*   **Recent Price:** Around R$ 8.78.
*   **Book Value per Share (VPA):** R$ 12.07 (2025).
*   **P/VP Ratio:** 0.97 (2025).
*   **Liquidity:** The average daily trading volume is approximately R$ 15.5 million.

**General Observations:**

*   GARE11 has undergone strategic changes, shifting from a pure logistics REIT (formerly GALG11) to a multi-strategy fund including logistics, retail, and urban income properties.
*   The fund has been selling assets to reduce debt and deleverage.
*   There was a proposal to increase the authorized capital significantly.

Without access to the specific quarterly report, I cannot fulfill the original request for a raw data log with YoY comparisons and management guidance.
