*   **Regulatory Change - New Gas Law:** Decree No. 12,153/24, enacted in August 2024, amends Decree No. 10,712/21 (Gas Decree). The goals are to increase gas supply and proposes greater governmental involvement in ensuring access to essential infrastructure by strengthening the powers of the ANP. The decree enhances the ANP's role in gas pricing and implements tariff regulation mechanisms for gas flow pipelines and other infrastructures. It also establishes measures to be regulated by the ANP to reduce the amount of gas Brazilian companies are required to re-inject into their operations.
*   **Regulatory Change - Royalty Rates:** Resolution 853/2021 permits a reduction in the royalty rate to 5% for fields operated by small-sized companies and to 7.5% for fields operated by medium-sized companies, subject to approval by the ANP.
