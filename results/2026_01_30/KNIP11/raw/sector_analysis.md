The main impacts on inflation in 2024 came from Food and Beverages, with a cumulative increase of 7.69% in 12 months and of 1.63 percentage points in the year.
*   The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) works to ensure that the twelve-month IPCA's inflation is centered at the inflation target set by the National Monetary Council (CMN).

**3. Regulatory Actions:**

*   **ANEEL (National Electric Energy Agency):** ANEEL is proposing the mandatory adoption of the New White Tariff for consumers with bills equal to or greater than 1,000 kWh/month. In 2025, ANEEL cancelled 509 permits for solar PV and wind power projects, representing approximately 22 gigawatts (GW) of planned capacity.
*   **ANP (National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels):** ANP data indicates Brazil produced 8.9mn m³ of biodiesel in January-November 2025.
*   **Central Bank of Brazil (BCB):** On April 24, 2025, the BCB announced its list of regulatory priorities for 2025 and 2026, including the evolution of Open Finance, virtual asset regulations, monitoring artificial intelligence usage, and the expansion of Pix's functionalities. The BCB issued three resolutions (BCB Nos. 519, 520 and 521) on November 10, 2025, establishing a regulatory framework for virtual asset services, effective February 2, 2026. The BCB is also reviewing bank fee regulations to improve and update the rules governing customer charges.

Markets such as the US and China are reopening to Brazilian beef, poultry and pork, which will support corrugated boxes and board shipments in Brazil.
*   **US Fed Rates:** No specific information was found in the search results regarding the direct impact of US Fed rates on the Brazilian Paper/Receivables sector.
*   **EU:** Tougher European targets for renewable fuel use look set to support demand and premiums for hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO).
