*   The agricultural sector is one of the main drivers of the economy, and in 2025, we forecast a growth of 6% from a record harvest for grains, which increases exports and strengthens the trade balance.

*   Banco do Brasil revised profit guidance for 2024.
*   BBAS3 is working with approximately 22 to 23 billion reais in profit, and if they take 30% of that and divide it by the market value, it would result in approximately 5% of dividends for this year.
