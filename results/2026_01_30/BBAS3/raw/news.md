Okay, I will compile a forensic log of material events for BBAS3 (Banco do Brasil S.A.) from the last 90 days, focusing on facts that alter the asset's risk/reward profile.

Here's a log of material events for Banco do Brasil (BBAS3) over the last 90 days:

*   **[2026-01-16] Legal & Compliance:** The Supreme Court (STF) extended the investigations into the purchase of Banco Master for 60 days. The request for extension was made by the Federal Police.
*   **[2025-11-26] Operational Disruptions:** Bet9ja's Sport T&C's indicates that the maximum cumulative payout for Bet9ja within any given 24 hour period will not exceed NGN 10,000,000,000. If the cumulative daily payout on all Bet9ja tickets exceeds this amount, any subsequent payout of the winnings on each valid bet will be adjusted accordingly.
*   **[No Date Specified] Sell-Side Activity:** XP Investimentos has a "Neutral" rating for BBAS3. The target price for 2026 was revised downwards to R$25/ação (from R$32/ação). XP expects continued pressure on agro non-performing loans, a delayed and gradual improvement, and normalization likely at worse levels than in recent years. Macro deceleration and high interest rates continue to affect retail and SME portfolios. Risk costs could reach 4.5% in 2025 and remain high in the coming years. Net interest income (NII) may continue to face pressure due to new accounting rules for interest recognition. Significant improvements in expense optimization are unlikely in the short term. XP revised downwards the net profit estimate for 2025 to R$ 20.6 billion, expecting a ROE below the cost of capital and a payout of 30%, implying a DY of 4.8%.
*   **[No Date Specified] Outlook:** Genial Analisa projects a net profit of R$ 40.0 billion for Banco do Brasil in 2025, a growth of +6.1% y/y, with a ROE of 19.7%. They anticipate a +10.4% y/y growth in the loan portfolio, driven mainly by agribusiness, which should benefit from improved soybean harvests and favorable weather conditions. This expansion should strengthen the Financial Revenue from Credit Operations, projected to grow by +12.1% y/y. Treasury results, benefiting from the high Selic rate, and control of administrative expenses and PDD should sustain profit expansion. On the negative side, the upward trend in agribusiness delinquency, observed in 4Q24, should extend throughout 1H25, with recovery only in 2H25.

Please note that analyst ratings and target prices can change frequently.
