Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Financials sector in Brazil, focusing on the external environment and adhering to the specified format and constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Financials sector in Brazil:

*   **Iron Ore Prices:**
    *   The current price of Iron Ore 62% futures is $105.77.
    *   The 52-week price range for Iron Ore 62% futures spans from $93.41 to $108.48.
    *   In the past year, the price of Iron Ore 62% futures has changed by 4.11%.
    *   Iron Ore increased to $97.84 USD/T, the highest since May 2025. Over the past 4 weeks, Iron Ore gained 2.59%, and in the last 12 months, it decreased 10.36%.
    *   Vale's iron ore fines prices fell to an average $91.6/t last year from $95.3/t a year earlier.

*   **Brent Oil Prices:**
    *   Brent crude oil surged to $68.36 USD per barrel on January 29, 2026. The rally has continued for the third consecutive session, with prices reaching their highest levels since late September last year.

*   **Pulp Prices:**
    *   Kraft Pulp rose to 5352 CNY/T on January 29, 2026, up 0.72% from the previous day.
    *   Over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 2.73%, and is down 13.12% compared to the same time last year.
    *   Eucalyptus pulplog prices increased as much as 97% from 1Q/20 to 1Q/23.
    *   The average mechanical wood pulp export price stood at $575 per ton in 2023, declining by -6.5% against the previous year.

*   **CBIO Prices:**
    *   I am unable to find information about CBIO prices.

*   **Interest Rates (Selic) & Inflation (IPCA):**
    *   Brazil's central bank maintained its benchmark rate at 15.00% in January 2026.
    *   The Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to keep the Selic rate at 15.00% per year during its meeting next Wednesday (January 28), preserving the current level of monetary tightening.
    *   Inflation expectations stand at 4.0% for 2026 and 3.8% for 2027, and Copom projects inflation at 3.2% by the third quarter of 2027.
    *   The 12-month cumulative IPCA rate closed 2025 at 4.26%.

*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   The Central Bank of Brazil issued three resolutions (BCB Nos. 519, 520 and 521) on November 10, 2025, establishing a regulatory framework for virtual asset services. The resolutions take effect on February 2, 2026.
    *   According to a proposed Central Bank regulation, additional capital of up to R$ 5,000,000.00 shall be required for commercial, investment or multiple banks to render virtual asset-related services.
    *   Joint Resolution No. 13, of December 3, 2024, took effect in January 2025, simplifying access for non-residents to Brazil's financial and capital markets.
    *   From January 2025, a regulatory change required online betting operators to become resident companies.
    *   Resolution CMN No. 5,187, of November 28, 2024, determined that large Brazilian financial institutions and conglomerates, as well as those institutions that perform critical functions for the functioning of the financial system, must follow resolution planning.

*   **Global Correlation:**
    *   The Brazilian stock market experienced a downturn on October 8, 2024, after China's stimulus package disappointed market expectations.
    *   Concerns about slowing economic indicators in China for September added to the market's unease and caused iron ore and oil prices to plummet by over 4%.
    *   If the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, US assets become more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real.
    *   The US GDP grew 4.4% in the third quarter of 2025.
    *   The IMF reduced its estimate for Brazilian GDP growth this year from 1.9% to 1.6%.
    *   The US imposed a 50% tariff on many products from Brazil, effective August 1st. If this scenario becomes long-lasting, with an effective tariff of around 40%, Brazil's GDP could potentially be reduced by 0.6% to 1.0%, though this impact could be mitigated by diversifying exports to other countries.
    *   The Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to keep the Selic rate at 15.00% per year during its meeting next Wednesday (January 28), preserving the current level of monetary tightening. More than the decision itself, investors' focus should be on the signals within the statement, particularly any indications of factors that could lead the Committee to start a rate-cut cycle as early as the March meeting.
    *   The US central bank is expected to maintain interest rates in the range of 3.50% to 3.75%.
