Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Utilities/Energy sector in Brazil, focusing on the specified drivers and adhering to the output requirements.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers impacting the Utilities/Energy sector in Brazil, as of January 30, 2026:

**1. Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Iron Ore:** The price of Iron Ore is $105.77 USD/T as of January 29, 2026. Over the past year, Iron Ore prices have increased by 4.38%. In the Brazilian domestic market, reference prices are $94/mt for the ore and $113/mt for pellets, ex-works and excluding taxes.
*   **CBIOs (Brazilian Decarbonization Credits):** In October 2024, CBIO prices rose by 17% over two weeks, reaching R$91 ($16), the highest level since May, driven by demand ahead of the 2024 compliance deadline. As of January 28, 2026, the last trade for CBIOs was R$ 29,50. Platts began publishing a price assessment for CBIOs in June 2024.
*   **Pulp Prices:** I am unable to find current data on pulp prices in Brazil.
*   **Brent Oil:** I am unable to find specific data on Brent Oil prices in Brazil.

**2. Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **Selic Rate:** The Central Bank of Brazil maintained the Selic rate at 15% during its November 2025 meeting. It is expected to gradually drop to 12.5% annually by the end of 2026. High interest rates consume a significant portion of cash flows for Brazilian utilities, as the majority of debt is floating rate.
*   **IPCA (Broad National Consumer Price Index):** In July 2025, inflation in Brazil hit 0.26%, with residential electricity recording the biggest individual impact on the index. Year-to-date inflation was 3.26%, and over the last 12 months, 5.23%. In December 2025, Brazil's headline inflation decelerated to an annual 4.26%. Residential electricity prices were up 10.6% from a year earlier in November 2025.

**3. Regulatory Actions:**

*   **ANEEL (National Electric Energy Agency):** ANEEL is proposing the mandatory adoption of the New White Tariff for consumers with bills equal to or greater than 1,000 kWh/month. ANEEL approved test operations for the 248-MWp Arapua Photovoltaic (PV) Complex in Ceara state. ANEEL has the prerogative of implementing policies, conducting auctions and concessions, managing contracts, establishing rules for the energy service, creating a methodology for calculating tariffs, supervising the supply of energy, and mediating conflicts between the operators and consumers.
*   **ANP (National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels):** A possible decision by the ANP to consider the accumulated volume of non-retired certificates in penalties against distributors could lead to higher CBIO prices.
*   **Central Bank of Brazil:** On November 10, 2025, the Central Bank of Brazil issued three resolutions (BCB Nos. 519, 520 and 521) establishing a regulatory framework for virtual asset services. Non-authorized payment institutions must apply for BCB accreditation to operate within Brazil's Pix instant payment system between January 1, 2026, and May 1, 2026.
*   **Tax Reform:** Complementary Law No. 214/2025 instituted a dual value-added tax (VAT) model to gradually substitute the current Brazilian taxation system, expected to be implemented between 2026 and 2033. The new taxation system will consist of CBS (Contribution on Goods and Services) and IBS (Tax on Goods and Services).
*   **New Gas Law:** Law No. 14,134/2021 modernizes the legal framework for the natural gas sector, regulating transportation, processing, storage, and commercialization.
*   **Law No. 15,097/2025** was enacted to regulate offshore energy potential, particularly offshore wind.
*   **Law No. 15,103/2025** launched the Energy Transition Acceleration Program (PATEN), aimed at financing private-sector sustainable projects.

**4. Global Correlation:**

*   **China Stimulus:** I am unable to find specific information about how recent China stimulus is influencing the Brazilian Utilities/Energy sector.
*   **US Fed Rates:** When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, it strengthens the dollar against other currencies, including the real. An expansionary monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve, such as lowering interest rates, tends to devalue the dollar and increase the purchasing power of the real. On January 28, 2026, US Federal Reserve policymakers held their target interest rate unchanged at 3.5-3.75pc.
*   **US Dollar Index (DXY):** The US dollar index (DXY) fell to its lowest since February 2022 on January 27, 2026, contributing to the strengthening of the Brazilian Real.
