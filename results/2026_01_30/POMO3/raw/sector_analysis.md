Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Industrial/Automotive sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Industrial/Automotive sector in Brazil, based on the provided search results:

### Commodity/Input Prices

*   **Iron Ore:** On January 29, 2026, Iron Ore fell to $105.77 USD/T, a 0.08% decrease from the previous day. However, it is still 4.38% higher than a year ago. BMI forecasts an average price of $95 USD/T in 2026. Vale forecasts iron ore prices to stabilize around $100/t in 2026.
*   **Brent Oil:** *I am sorry, but I cannot provide the current Brent Oil price with the available search results.*
*   **Pulp:** Fastmarkets forecasts a tightening market, with operating rates hitting 91% in 2026 and 2027. As of January 15, 2026, the benchmark price for hardwood pulp was 4750.00 RMB/ton, a 1.42% increase compared to the beginning of the month. Kraft Pulp is expected to trade at 5299.10 CNY/T by the end of Q1 2026.
*   **CBIOs (Brazilian Decarbonization Credits):** As of September 2025, CBIO prices rose to 48 BRL/CBIO, a 77% increase in the month. The government's CBIO target for 2026 is 66.49 million.

### Interest Rates & Inflation

*   **Selic Rate:** In December 2025, the Selic policy rate remained at 15.00%. The Central Bank maintained the Selic rate at 15% over the last six months, arguing this is necessary to anchor inflation. The first rate cut is expected in March 2026.
*   **Impact of Selic:** The 15% Selic rate keeps borrowing costs elevated for consumers. Vehicle financing grew 2.3% month-over-month in November 2025, supported by digital origination and bundled offers. High dependence on credit makes the automotive sector vulnerable to the restrictive Selic rate.
*   **IPCA (Inflation):** Inflation ran at 4.26% in 2025 and is projected at 4% in 2026. Headline inflation decelerated to an annual 4.26% in December 2025.
*   **Car Loans:** The average cost of car loans reached 29.5% per year. The Brazil car loan market is projected to reach USD 113.7 billion by 2031, with a 4.80% CAGR.

### Regulatory Actions

*   **Hybrid Vehicle Certification:** In 2025, a new ISO guide became mandatory for hybrid vehicle certification.
*   **RenovaBio Program:** The government has set individual preliminary targets for fuel distributors based on market share data between January-October. The definitive targets will be published by March 31, 2026. The CBIO target for 2026 is 66.49 million.
*   **Trade Agreements:** An agreement on Mutual Recognition of Vehicle Approvals with Argentina was incorporated into Argentina's legal system in June 2024.
*   **Tariffs:** Brazil is weighing tariff increases on EV imports, potentially raising the rate from the current 10 percent to 35 percent.

### Global Correlation

*   **China:** Chinese automakers accounted for 10% of all passenger vehicles sold in Brazil in 2025. Chinese EV giants are expanding into Brazil, with brands like BYD accounting for over 80% of electric car sales. Imports from China to Brazil have increased significantly. Several Chinese automakers plan to begin local EV assembly in 2026.
*   **US Fed Rates:** *I am sorry, but I cannot provide information on how US Fed Rates are influencing the Brazilian Automotive sector with the available search results.*
*   **US Tariffs:** In July 2026, the Trump administration announced new reciprocal tariff rates, including 50% for Brazil.
*   **General:** The Brazilian Real has strengthened, partly due to a global weakening of the US dollar.
