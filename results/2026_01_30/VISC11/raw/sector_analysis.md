Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic analysis of the Shopping Malls sector in Brazil, focusing on the specified drivers and adhering to the output requirements.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Shopping Malls sector in Brazil:

### Commodity/Input Prices

*   **Iron Ore:** The price of iron ore is $105.77 USD/T as of January 29, 2026. Over the past year, the price of Iron Ore 62% futures has changed by 4.38%.
*   **Kraft Pulp:** The price of Kraft Pulp is 5,352 CNY/T as of January 29, 2026. The price is down 13.12% compared to the same time last year.
*   **CBIOs (Decarbonization Credits):** In October 2024, CBIO prices rose by 17% over two weeks, reaching R$91 ($16), the highest level since May 2024. As of January 28, 2026, the last CBIO trade was R$ 29,50.

### Interest Rates & Inflation

*   **Inflation (IPCA):** Brazil's headline inflation decelerated to an annual 4.26% in December 2025.
*   **GDP Growth:** Real GDP is projected to grow by 2.4% in 2025, moderating to 1.7% in 2026, and rebounding to 2.2% in 2027.
*   **Interest Rates (Selic):** The central bank maintained the target rate at 15% since June 2025. High interest rates are expected to weigh on investment in 2026.

### Regulatory Actions

*   **New Tax Rules:** Brazil is transitioning to a fully software-driven model for retail transaction taxation, moving away from hardware-based fiscal devices. By 2026, this software model will be mandatory in all states.
*   **CBIO Penalties:** A possible decision by Brazil's hydrocarbon regulator ANP to consider the accumulated volume of non-retired certificates in penalties against distributors could lead to higher prices.

### Global Correlation

*   **US Fed Rate Hikes:** When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, US assets become more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real. This depreciation increases the cost of importing inputs and raises financing costs for Brazilian companies.
*   **China's Impact:** Brazil's central bank chief said that China is exporting "disinflation or even deflation" to Brazil through a surge in low-cost imports, easing inflation. Chinese companies are also increasing investments in Brazil.
*   **US Tariffs:** New tariffs imposed by the US may impact Brazil's attractiveness to global investors and the dynamics of Brazilian assets.
