Okay, I'm ready to perform the financial data extraction and create the log. I will now perform a search to locate the most recent quarterly results (earnings release) and management guidance for ABCB4.

Okay, I have gathered information from the searches. Based on the search results, I will focus on Q3 2025 (ending September 30, 2025) as the latest reported quarter and compare it to Q3 2024. I will also look for any full-year guidance.
