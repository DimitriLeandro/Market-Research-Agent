Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Financials sector in Brazil, focusing on external drivers and adhering to the specified format and constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers impacting the Financials sector in Brazil:

*   **Iron Ore Prices:**
    *   The price of Iron Ore Fine China Import (62% grade Spot Cost and Freight for delivery at the Chinese port of Tianjin) increased to $97.84 USD/T, the highest since May 2025.
    *   Over the past 4 weeks, Iron Ore gained 2.59%, and in the last 12 months, it decreased 10.36%.
    *   Brazil is the world's second-largest exporter of iron ore, accounting for nearly 30% of global exports.
    *   In November 2025, Brazil exported $2.55B of iron ore.
    *   Vale increased its iron ore production to 336mn t in 2025, up by 2.6pc compared with a year earlier.

    *   The average CBIO price was R$59.30 ($10.70) on 13 May 2025, its lowest since September 2022.
    *   By June 12, 2025, the price had recovered slightly, reaching R$59.50.
    *   In 2022, CBIOs had an average price of R$112 from January 1 to December 12.
    *   The carbon credit acquisition target under Brazil's national biofuel policy Renovabio for 2025 should range between 36.2mn-48.9mn Cbios.

*   **Interest Rates (Selic) and Inflation (IPCA):**
    *   The benchmark interest rate in Brazil was last recorded at 15 percent in January 2026.
    *   Brazil's central bank maintained its benchmark rate at 15.00% in January, saying a prolonged hold is needed to keep inflation on a steady path toward the target amid elevated uncertainty.
    *   Interest Rate in Brazil is expected to be 14.50 percent by the end of this quarter.
    *   The Brazil Interest Rate is projected to trend around 10.50 percent in 2027.
    *   Inflation expectations stand at 4.0% for 2026 and 3.8% for 2027, and Copom projects inflation at 3.2% by the third quarter of 2027.
    *   December 2025 IPCA showed an acceleration of 0.33%, compared to 0.18% in the previous month.
    *   The 12-month cumulative IPCA rate closed 2025 at 4.26%.
    *   The Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to keep the Selic rate at 15.00% per year during its meeting next Wednesday (January 28, 2026).
    *   In the current cycle of rising Selic rates, which began in September 2024, interest payments increased from R$ 819.7 billion over 12 months to R$ 918.2 billion last November.

*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   Resolution CMN No. 5,187, of November 28, 2024, determined that large Brazilian financial institutions and conglomerates must implement recovery and resolution planning.
    *   Law No. 14,478/2022, along with Decree No. 11,563/2023, granted the Central Bank the authority to regulate crypto asset service providers in Brazil.
    *   The Central Bank conducted a public hearing in 2024 to gather input on the BaaS regulations it plans to issue in 2025.
    *   Law No. 14,286/2021 (effective as of December 31, 2022) provided a new legal framework for the Brazilian foreign exchange market.
    *   Joint Resolution No. 13, of December 3, 2024, which took effect in January 2025, simplified access for non-residents to Brazil's financial and capital markets.
    *   The Central Bank of Brazil issued three resolutions (BCB Nos. 519, 520 and 521) on 10 November 2025, establishing a regulatory framework for virtual asset services, effective February 2, 2026.
    *   Complementary Law No. 227/2026 (“CL No. 227/2026”) was published on 14 January 2026, marking the second stage of implementation of the Consumption Tax Reform.
    *   On September 5, 2025, the Brazilian Central Bank (BCB) issued a series of measures to strengthen the safety of the country's National Financial System (Sistema Financeiro Nacional).

*   **Global Correlation:**
    *   When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, US assets become more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real.
    *   Increased U.S. involvement in external disputes has heightened perceptions of political instability in the country, driving a flight from U.S. assets and favoring currencies with higher interest rate differentials, such as the real.
    *   Expectations of steady U.S. interest rates, combined with the possibility of signaling a prolonged pause in rate cuts, are likely to sustain Treasury yields and favor the dollar globally.
    *   A potential rhetorical opening for the start of Brazil's Selic rate cut cycle as early as March could lower expectations for the Brazilian interest rate differential, reducing the relative attractiveness of domestic assets and putting depreciation pressure on the real.
    *   New tariffs imposed by the US may initially seem like a sectoral issue, but one of the main positive effects is the redirection of investments, as global companies facing restrictions in the US may seek alternative suppliers, benefiting Brazil, particularly in the agricultural and industrial sectors.
    *   If a 50% tariff scenario becomes long-lasting, with an effective tariff of around 40%, Brazil's GDP could potentially be reduced by 0.6% to 1.0%, though this impact could be mitigated by diversifying exports to other countries.
    *   Japan enacted major tax reforms in March 2025, introducing a 4% special defence surtax on corporate income tax for fiscal years starting from 1 April 2026.
