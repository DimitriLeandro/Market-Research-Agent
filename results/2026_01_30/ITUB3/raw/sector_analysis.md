Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Financials sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers impacting the Financials sector in Brazil, as of January 30, 2026:

**1. Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Iron Ore:** The price of Iron Ore Fine China Import 62% grade Spot Cost and Freight for delivery at the Chinese port of Tianjin increased to $97.84 USD/T. Over the past year, iron ore decreased 10.36%. In June 2025, the average export price was $63.7/t FOB, compared to $76.5/t in June 2024.
*   **Brent Oil:** Brent Crude rose to $70.76 USD/Bbl on January 29, 2026, a 3.46% increase from the previous day. Over the past month, Brent's price has risen 15.38%, but it is still 6.75% lower than a year ago.
*   **Pulp Prices:** Kraft Pulp rose to 5352 CNY/T on January 29, 2026, up 0.72% from the previous day. Over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 2.73%, and is down 13.12% compared to the same time last year. In 2024, the average wood pulp export price was $537 per ton, a 29% increase compared to 2023.
*   **CBIOs:** No specific data found on current CBIO (Certificados de Descarbonização) prices.

**2. Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **Selic Rate:** The Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to keep the Selic rate at 15.00% per year.
*   **Impact of Selic:** A rising Selic rate increases the government's cost of servicing debt. Elevated interest rates and high bank lending costs constrain consumer and business credit.
*   **IPCA Inflation:** The 12-month cumulative IPCA rate closed 2025 at 4.26%. In November 2025, the Brazil IPCA: Inflation Surprise: Actual IPCA: Last 12 months data was reported at 4.460 %.
*   **Impact of IPCA:** High inflation can erode the real value of tax revenues and increase government expenditure costs.

**3. Regulatory Actions:**

*   **Virtual Asset Regulations:** On November 10, 2025, the Central Bank of Brazil issued resolutions BCB Nos. 519, 520 and 521, establishing a regulatory framework for virtual asset services, effective February 2, 2026.
*   **Taxation Changes (2025):** Provisional Measure No. 1,303/2025, published on June 11, 2025, increased the taxation of Interest on Net Equity (INE) payments from 15% to 20%, effective January 1, 2026. It also introduced a 5% withholding tax on income from certain financial investments related to real estate and agribusiness, effective January 1, 2026.
*   **IOF-FX Rate Reduction (2025):** Decree No. 12,499/2025, also published on June 11, 2025, reduced the IOF-FX rate on the return of foreign investment to 0%, effective immediately.
*   **Central Bank Regulatory Priorities (2025/2026):** On April 24, 2025, the Central Bank of Brazil announced its regulatory priorities for 2025 and 2026, including Open Finance, virtual asset regulations, monitoring AI usage, and expansion of Pix functionalities.
*   **Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirements (2026):** The Central Bank updated minimum regulatory capital requirements with a new modular methodology and transition timeline, starting in June 2026 and ending in December 2027.

**4. Global Correlation:**

*   **China's Stimulus:** Disappointing stimulus packages from China can cause iron ore and oil prices to decrease.
*   **US Fed Rate Hikes:** When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, US assets become more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real. This depreciation increases the cost of importing inputs and raises financing costs for Brazilian companies.
*   **US Tariffs:** Tariffs imposed by the US on Brazil can damage America's reputation and increase animosity toward Washington, while increasing Beijing's popularity. A long-lasting 50% tariff by the U.S. could reduce Brazil's GDP by 0.6% to 1.0%.
*   **Global Economy:** Global economic conditions, the strength of the US dollar, and geopolitical events can impact Brazil's inflation.
*   **IMF Outlook:** The IMF projects global headline inflation to decline from 4.1% in 2025 to 3.8% in 2026.
