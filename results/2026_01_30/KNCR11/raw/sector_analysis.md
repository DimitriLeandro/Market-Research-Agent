Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Paper/Receivables sector in Brazil, focusing on the external environment and adhering to the specified constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Paper/Receivables sector in Brazil:

However, over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 2.73%, and it is down 13.12% compared to the same time last year. Trading Economics expects Kraft Pulp to trade at 5299.10 CNY/T by the end of this quarter and 5018.56 CNY/T in 12 months. On January 28, 2026, Brazilian pulp maker Suzano announced it would increase pulp prices in February by $10 per metric ton for its clients in Asia, including China, and by $30 per ton in Europe and the Americas.

Over the past month, Iron Ore's price has fallen 1.27%, but it is still 4.38% higher than a year ago. Trading Economics expects Iron Ore to trade at 107.10 USD/MT by the end of this quarter and 110.45 USD/MT in 12 months. Vale forecasts iron ore prices will stabilize at around $100/t in 2026.

*   **Brent Oil Prices:** On January 29, 2026, Brent rose to 70.76 USD/Bbl, up 3.46% from the previous day. Over the past month, Brent's price has risen 15.38%, but it is still 6.75% lower than a year ago.

The EIA forecasts the Brent crude oil price will average $56 per barrel in 2026, 19% less than in 2025. Fitch Ratings forecasts Brent at $65/bbl for 2026.

*   **CBIOs:** No specific data points were found for current CBIO (Certificados de Descarbonização) prices.

*   **Interest Rates (Selic) and Inflation (IPCA):** The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) works to ensure that the twelve-month IPCA's inflation is centered at the inflation target set by the National Monetary Council (CMN). The IPCA is the reference for the Brazilian inflation-targeting system. In December 2024, the Extended National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) hit 0.52%, and the official inflation index closed the year with a cumulative increase of 4.83%.

*   **Regulatory Actions (ANEEL):** ANEEL is proposing the mandatory adoption of the New White Tariff for consumers with bills equal to or greater than 1,000 kWh/month, which is generating debate about its technical feasibility and financial impacts. In 2025, ANEEL cancelled 509 permits for solar PV and wind power projects, representing approximately 22 gigawatts (GW) of planned capacity.

*   **Regulatory Actions (ANP):** In January-November 2025, Brazil produced 8.9mn m³ of biodiesel, according to data from hydrocarbons regulator ANP.

*   **Regulatory Actions (Central Bank):** On April 24, 2025, the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) announced its list of regulatory priorities for 2025 and 2026, including the evolution of Open Finance, virtual asset regulations, monitoring artificial intelligence usage, and the expansion of Pix's functionalities. The BCB issued three resolutions (BCB Nos. 519, 520 and 521) on November 10, 2025, establishing a regulatory framework for virtual asset services, effective February 2, 2026.

*   **New Legislation (Taxes, Concessions):** On December 26, 2025, Complementary Law (LC) No. 224/2025 was enacted, providing for the reduction of federal tax incentives through a linear cut. On December 17, 2025, Brazil's Congress approved Complementary Bill No. 128/2025, mandating reductions in federal tax incentives and increasing the withholding tax rate on Interest on Net Equity (INE) to 17.5%, effective from January 1, 2026. Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva signed into law an expansion of the federal income tax exemption for workers earning up to 5,000 reais a month and the creation of a minimum tax for high-income taxpayers.

*   **Global Correlation (China Stimulus):** China's influence on iron ore prices is considerable, given its position as the world's leading steel producer and importer of base metals.

*   **Global Correlation (US Fed Rates):** When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, US assets become more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real. This depreciation increases the cost of importing inputs and raises financing costs for Brazilian companies, reducing their investment capacity.
