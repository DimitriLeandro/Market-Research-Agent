Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Brazilian mining sector, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates and inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations. I will avoid mentioning specific companies and adhere to the specified format and tone.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Brazilian mining sector:

**1. Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Iron Ore:** On January 29, 2026, Iron Ore fell to $105.77 USD/T. Over the past month, the price has fallen 1.27%, but it is still 4.38% higher than a year ago. Another source indicates a current level of $104.59, which is up 2.06% from last month and 2.33% from one year ago.
*   **Brent Oil:** On January 29, 2026, Brent rose to $70.76 USD/Bbl. Over the past month, Brent's price has risen 15.38%, but it is still 6.75% lower than a year ago.
*   **Kraft Pulp:** On January 29, 2026, Kraft Pulp rose to 5352 CNY/T. Over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 2.73%, and is down 13.12% compared to the same time last year.
*   **CBIOs (Decarbonization Credits):** In October 2024, CBIO prices rose by 17% over two weeks to R$91 ($16), the highest level since May, driven by demand to meet 2024 goals under the Renovabio policy. On January 28, 2026, the last trade was R$ 29,50.

**2. Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **Selic Rate:** The Central Bank of Brazil maintained the Selic rate at 15.00% in January 2026. The bank expects to begin cutting rates again in March.
*   **Inflation (IPCA):** Brazil's headline inflation decelerated to an annual 4.26% in December 2025.

**3. Regulatory Actions:**

*   **ANM Resolution No. 223/2025:** Effective from November 23, 2025, this resolution updates the sanctioning and penalty regime for infractions in the mining sector, establishing stricter penalty criteria.
*   **Law No. 14,514/2022:** Enacted in 2023, this law extends the mineral exploration license term to four years, extendable for another four years if certain conditions are met. It also allows a wider range of mineral rights to be used as collateral in financing transactions.

**4. Global Correlation:**

*   **China:** In 2024, 35% of Brazilian mining exports (approximately US$23.5 million) were shipped to China. Iron accounts for 85% of the total value of mining exports and 99% of the volume shipped. Chinese stimulus measures are expected to maintain demand for iron ore.
*   **US Federal Reserve:** When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, US assets become more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real.
*   **US Tariffs:** A potential 50% tariff by the United States on products imported from Brazil could significantly affect the mining industry. In 2024, the United States accounted for 4% of Brazil's mining exports and ranked as the 12th largest importer of Brazilian minerals by volume.
