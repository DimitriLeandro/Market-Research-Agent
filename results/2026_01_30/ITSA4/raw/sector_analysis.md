Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Financials/Holding sector in Brazil, focusing on external drivers, without mentioning any specific company.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural factors impacting the Financials/Holding sector in Brazil:

**1. Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Iron Ore:** On January 29, 2026, Iron Ore was at $105.77 USD/T, a 0.08% decrease from the previous day. It is 4.38% higher than a year ago. Brazilian 65% Fe iron ore fell from $124/mt to $118/mt CFR China as of January 21, 2026.
*   **CBIOs (Brazilian Decarbonization Credits):** The average CBIO price was R$59.30 ($10.70) on May 13, 2025, the lowest since September 2022. As of June 12, 2025, the price had slightly recovered to R$59.50. In October 2024, CBIO prices rose by 17% over two weeks, reaching R$91 ($16), the highest since May 2024. On January 28, 2026, the last trade for CBIO was R$ 29,50.

**2. Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **Selic Rate:** The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) is expected to maintain the Selic rate at 15.00% per year. Investors are closely watching for signals about potential rate cuts as early as March. A potential rate-cut cycle could reduce the attractiveness of domestic assets.
*   **IPCA (Inflation Index):** The 12-month cumulative IPCA rate closed 2025 at 4.26%, within the tolerance bands. In December 2024, the IPCA hit 0.52%, resulting in a cumulative increase of 4.83% for 2024.

**3. Regulatory Actions:**

*   **Central Bank of Brazil (BCB):** On November 10, 2025, the BCB issued resolutions 519, 520, and 521, establishing a regulatory framework for virtual asset services. These resolutions define and regulate virtual asset service providers (VASPs), set authorization and operational requirements, and integrate virtual asset activities into Brazil’s foreign exchange regime. The BCB issued Resolution No. 496 to amend aspects of BCB Resolution No. 1/2020, establishing and regulating the Pix payment scheme.
*   **ANEEL (National Electric Energy Agency):** ANEEL is considering mandatory adoption of the "New White Tariff" for consumers with bills equal to or greater than 1,000 kWh/month. ANEEL approved EDP Espírito Santo's regulatory parameters for the 2025-2030 period, effective from August 7, 2025.
*   **Tax Changes:** Provisional Measure No. 1,303/2025 increased the tax on Interest on Net Equity (INE) payments from 15% to 20%, effective January 1, 2026. A fixed 17.5% WHT general rate on income derived from financial investments was introduced. On November 26, 2025, Brazil's President approved Law No. 15,270/2025, introducing new rules for minimum taxation of income and withholding taxation of profits and dividends, effective January 1, 2026.

**4. Global Correlation:**

*   **China:** Chinese investments in Brazil totaled US$4.18 billion in 2024, a 113% increase compared to 2023. A disappointing stimulus package in China led to a downturn in the Brazilian stock market in October 2024, impacting iron ore and oil prices. China's growth numbers for 2025 came in at 5%, with expectations of 4.5% growth in 2026.
*   **US Federal Reserve (FED):** US Fed rate hikes strengthen the dollar, decreasing Brazil's purchasing power. Conversely, expansionary monetary policy by the Fed devalues the dollar and increases the purchasing power of the Real. New US tariffs may impact Brazil's capital market.
*   **Geopolitical Tensions:** Geopolitical tensions involving the U.S. have influenced the search for "safe-haven" assets, potentially favoring the Brazilian Real due to its interest rate differential.
