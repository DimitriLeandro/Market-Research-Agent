Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Retail sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Retail sector in Brazil:

**Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   Brazilian retail is closely linked to Global Value Chains (GVCs) in both imports and exports of agricultural products, textiles, and electronics.
*   Soybeans, coffee, and meat are examples of goods that often cross borders, inserting Brazil into global production networks.

**Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   In **January 2026**, Brazil's central bank maintained its benchmark interest rate at **15.00%**. The committee anticipates initiating the easing of monetary policy at its next meeting, but reiterates that it will maintain appropriate restraint to ensure inflation converges to the target.
*   The Central Bank signals another significant hike to **14.25%** at its **March 2025** meeting.
*   Financial market analysts raised their **2025** inflation forecast for Brazil to **5.68%**.
*   **December 2025** saw consumer prices rise **4.3%** on a year-on-year basis.
*   **August 2025** twelve-month inflation rate reached **5.1 percent**.
*   **January 2025**, inflation ended at **4.83 percent**.
*   Retail sales in Brazil increased **1.30 percent** in **November of 2025** over the same month in the previous year.
*   **December 2023**, the level of indebtedness of Brazilians was around **77%**, reaching a peak of **79%** in **June 2024**.

**Regulatory Actions:**

*   As of **January 1, 2026**, Brazil operates a nationwide software-based fiscalization system, requiring the issuance of electronic fiscal documents (NFC-e or NF-e) for sales to end consumers, including e-commerce transactions.
*   By **2026**, a federal rule mandates a software model must be mandatory in all states and that the sale, development and use of hardware-based fiscal devices such as fiscal printers, SAT and MFE will no longer be permitted.
*   From **2026**, CBS and IBS are introduced in a pilot phase at very low rates—**0.9%** for CBS and **0.1%** for IBS—without immediately abolishing existing taxes.
*   The Remessa Conforme program created a standardized regime for international parcels, allowing compliant platforms to offer low-value imports with clearer taxation.
*   In **2024**, the de minimis exemption ended on **August 1**, and a tariff of **20 percent** is now considered for consignments up to **USD50**, plus **17 percent** of the state tax.
*   From **USD50.01** to **USD3,000**, **60 percent** of the national and **17 percent** of the state tax will be levied.

**Global Correlation:**

*   Cross-border e-commerce, especially low-ticket imports from Chinese platforms like Shopee, Shein, AliExpress and Temu, has grown quickly in recent years.
*   Tighter controls are being placed on cross-border e-commerce, with the government removing exemptions and issuing fines on parcels that fall outside the compliance program or have mis-declared values.
*   External factors such as US economic conditions and global financial volatility continue to affect emerging markets.
*   Devaluation of the dollar makes imports cheaper.
*   The new enforcement will apply a 60% tax to all imported goods valued under $50.
