Okay, I will compile a forensic log of material events for KNCA11 (Kinea Crédito Agro FII) from the last 90 days, focusing on facts that alter the asset's risk/reward profile.

Here's a log of material events for KNCA11 (Kinea Crédito Agro FII) from the last 90 days:

*   **[2026-01-14]** KNCA11 paid a dividend of R$1.20 per share. This dividend represents a tax-exempt yield of 1.18% for individuals, considering an average entry price of R$101.77, which corresponds to 97% of the DI rate for the period (114% of the CDI considering the gross-up of IR at a rate of 15%).
*   **[2026-01-13]** Kinea Investimentos reported that KNCA11 will pay R$1.20 per share, which will be credited to investors on January 14. This result reflects the higher number of business days in December, mainly benefiting the CDI portion of the portfolio. Approximately 50% of the portfolio is in IPCA and 50% in CDI. In December, a R$50 million FIDIC was repaid, and three new operations were carried out for a total volume of R$90 million.
*   **[2025-12-31]** Fiagros increased dividends in the last announcement of the year.

*   **[2025-09-05]** KNCA11 will pay R$ 1 per share on September 11, equivalent to a dividend yield of 1.06% per month. This result was influenced by the smaller number of business days in August (21) compared to July (23). Approximately 60% of the fund's portfolio is linked to CDI operations and 40% to IPCA. In August, an operation of approximately R$ 30 million was settled.

I have found no information about legal & compliance issues, sell-side activity (upgrades or downgrades), or operational disruptions in the last 90 days.
