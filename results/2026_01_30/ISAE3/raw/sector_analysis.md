Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Utilities/Energy sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers impacting the Utilities/Energy sector in Brazil, as of January 30, 2026:

**1. Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Iron Ore:** The price of Brazilian 65% Fe iron ore experienced a sharp weekly decline, falling from $124/mt to $118/mt CFR China as of January 21, 2026. This decrease is attributed to the delivery of the first Simandou iron ore cargo to China and rising iron ore stockpiles in Chinese ports. Iron ore decreased to 105.85 USD/T, the lowest since November 2025. Over the past 4 weeks, Iron Ore lost 0.98%, and in the last 12 months, it increased 4.67%.
*   **Brent Oil:** The EIA projects Brent crude prices to decline from $69.04 per barrel in 2025 to $55.87 per barrel in 2026. A further reduction to $54.02 per barrel is expected in 2027.
*   **Pulp Prices:** In April 2025, the average mechanical wood pulp import price was $664 per ton, an 18% increase compared to the previous month. However, overall, the import price has seen a pronounced curtailment. Kraft Pulp rose to 5352 CNY/T on January 29, 2026, up 0.72% from the previous day. Over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 2.73%, and is down 13.12% compared to the same time last year.
*   **CBIOs (Brazilian Decarbonization Credits):** Average CBIO trading prices were at their lowest levels since 2022 as of June 16, 2025, mainly reflecting insecurity caused by sector defaults and oversupply from suppressed demand. The average CBIO price was R$59.30 ($10.70) on May 13, 2025, the lowest since September 2022. By June 12, 2025, the price had slightly recovered to R$59.50.

**2. Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **Selic Rate:** As of January 2026, the Brazil Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to maintain the Selic rate at 15.00% per year. The central bank is expected to hold its target rate unchanged at a policy meeting on Wednesday, and is only expected to begin cutting rates again in March.
*   **Inflation (IPCA):** Brazil's headline inflation decelerated to an annual 4.26% in December 2025, which was lower than market expectations. Residential electricity prices were up 10.6% from a year earlier. In October 2025, electricity price growth eased to just 3.1% after the National Electric Energy Agency reduced the red flag level from two to one between September and October.

**3. Regulatory Actions:**

*   **ANEEL (Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica):** ANEEL reduced the red flag level, cutting the extra cost of electricity by roughly 40% between September and October 2025. ANEEL is the electricity regulator that regulates Brazil's power sector and oversees auctions for electricity transmission, generation, and distribution contracts.
*   **ANP (Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis):** A possible decision by Brazil's hydrocarbon regulator ANP to consider the accumulated volume of non-retired certificates in penalties against distributors could lead to higher CBIO prices. ANP regulates oil and gas contracts and oversees auctions for oil and natural gas exploration and production.
*   **New Gas Law:** Law No. 14,134/2021 (the New Gas Law) modernizes the legal framework for the natural gas sector, regulating transportation, processing, storage, and commercialization to foster a more competitive market.

**4. Global Correlation:**

*   **China:** Delivery of the first Simandou iron ore cargo to China contributed to a decline in Brazilian iron ore prices.
*   **US Fed Rates:** Political uncertainty in the US, including "[President] Donald Trump's more volatile rhetoric" have helped pressure the US currency downwards. Investors are seeking assets in emerging and other markets away from the US as a result, which is also contributing. Renewed fears of a US government shutdown have also weighed on the US currency.
*   **US Dollar:** The Brazilian real ended Tuesday's trading session at R5.20/$1 on January 27, 2026, the strongest closing level since May 2024 and a near 14pc appreciation in 12 months. The Brazilian currency has been strengthening sharply since 23 December, when it weakened to roughly R5.59/$1, partly thanks to the central bank's firm maintenance of the target rate at 15pc since June last year.
*   **Geopolitical Tensions Involving the U.S.:** Throughout this week, the U.S. engaged in new geopolitical discussions amid heightened tensions with the European Union over Greenland and renewed threats of military intervention in Iran. U.S. involvement in external agendas has reinforced investor insecurity regarding political stability in the country, resulting in a flight from U.S. assets, including the dollar, and favoring other currencies, notably the Brazilian real.
