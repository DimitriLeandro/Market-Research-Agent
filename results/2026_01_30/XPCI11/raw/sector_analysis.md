Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Paper/Receivables sector in Brazil, focusing on external drivers and adhering to the specified format and constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers impacting the Paper/Receivables sector in Brazil:

*   **Iron Ore Prices:** On January 29, 2026, Iron Ore was priced at $105.77 USD/T, a 0.08% decrease from the previous day. Over the past month, the price has decreased by 1.27%, but it is 4.38% higher than a year ago.

*   **Brent Crude Oil:** The value of Brent Crude Oil is 349.33 Brazilian Real. Another source states that the conversion value for 1 OIL to R$382.33.

*   **Pulp Prices:** Kraft Pulp was at 5352 CNY/T on January 29, 2026, a 0.72% increase from the previous day. However, over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 2.73%, and is down 13.12% compared to the same time last year. Latin American pulp industry is grappling with an 18% price decline in the first quarter.

*   **CBIO Prices:** The average CBIO price was R$59.30 ($10.70) on May 13, 2025, its lowest since September 2022. On June 12, 2025, the price had recovered slightly to R$59.50. As of January 28, 2026, the last trade for CBIO was R$ 29,50.

*   **Selic Rate:** The Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to maintain the Selic rate at 15.00% per year. A potential start to Brazil's Selic rate cut cycle as early as March could lower expectations for the Brazilian interest rate differential, reducing the relative attractiveness of domestic assets and putting depreciation pressure on the real.

*   **IPCA Inflation:** The National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) for December 2025 showed an acceleration of 0.33%, compared to 0.18% in the previous month. The 12-month cumulative rate closed 2025 at 4.26%, marking the second consecutive month within the tolerance bands.

*   **ANP Regulatory Actions:** A decision by Brazil's hydrocarbon regulator ANP to consider the accumulated volume of non-retired certificates in penalties against distributors could lead to higher CBIO prices.

*   **China's Influence:** China is the world's largest pulp market, accounting for 42% of global consumption. From January to September 2024, China was the destination for 43% of Brazilian pulp exports, totaling $4.97 billion.

*   **US Tariffs:** In July 2025, the U.S. President announced plans to impose a 50% tariff on all imports from Brazil, with the policy slated to take effect August 1, 2025.
