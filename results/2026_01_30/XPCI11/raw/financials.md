Okay, I understand. I will act as a Financial Auditor and Forensic Accountant and extract the requested financial data for XPCI11 from its most recent quarterly results and management guidance, focusing on YoY comparisons and providing context for changes. I will then present the findings in a raw data log format.
Okay, I have gathered information on XPCI11. Based on the search results, here's the financial data log. I will focus on extracting concrete figures and YoY comparisons where available.

**XPCI11 - Financial Data Log**

*   **Overview**: XPCI11 is a Real Estate Investment Fund (FII) focused on investments in real estate-backed financial assets like CRIs (Certificados de Recebíveis Imobiliários).

*   **Dividend Information**:

    *   The latest dividend announced was R$ 0.88 per share with ex-dividend date of January 1, 2026.
    *   The fund distributes dividends monthly.
    *   The dividend yield is 12.28%.
*   **October 2025 Performance**:

    *   The fund announced a distribution of R$ 0.90 per share, corresponding to a monthly dividend yield of 1.08% and an annualized yield of 13.79%.
    *   Net assets were R$ 769.5 million, with 86.63% allocated to CRIs and 85% exposure to the IPCA.
*   **Revenue (January to April 2025)**:

    *   The fund's revenue reached R$ 3.61 per share, an 8% decrease compared to the same period last year (YoY).
    *   This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in revenue from CRIs (-8.0% YoY) due to lower capital gains compared to 2024 and a lower inflow of interest income at the beginning of 2025.
*   **Expenses and Profit (January to April 2025)**:

    *   Operating expenses decreased by 17%, limiting the decline in profit and distributed value, which fell by 7% and 5% respectively, compared to the previous year.
*   **Valuation and Recommendation**:

    *   XP reiterates a buy recommendation based on efficient management, a low-risk credit portfolio with robust guarantees, an attractive trading price (VM/VP of 0.88x), and an attractive carry, with a net implied return of IPCA + 9.60% p.a. and an estimated yield of 13.3% in their base scenario for the next 12 months.

**Note**: I was unable to find the specific figures for Net Revenue, EBITDA, Net Income, Operating Cash Flow, and Free Cash Flow for the most recent quarter versus the same quarter last year. I also could not find specific management guidance for the full year. The available data is primarily related to dividend distributions, portfolio composition, and some commentary on revenue trends from January to April 2025.
