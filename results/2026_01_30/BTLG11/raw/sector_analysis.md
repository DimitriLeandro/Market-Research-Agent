Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Logistics sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural factors impacting the Logistics sector in Brazil, as of January 30, 2026:

**1. Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Iron Ore:** The price of Iron Ore is at USD 105.85/T, the lowest since November 2025. Over the past year, it has increased by 4.67%.
*   **Brent Oil:** Brent Crude oil is priced at USD 70.76/Bbl on January 29, 2026, a 3.46% increase from the previous day. However, it is 6.75% lower than a year ago.
*   **Pulp:** Kraft Pulp was priced at 5352 CNY/T on January 29, 2026, up 0.72% from the previous day. Over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 2.73%, and is down 13.12% compared to the same time last year. Wood costs for pulpmills in Brazil steadily increased across 2022 and so far in 2023. Prices for softwood and hardwood pulplogs doubled in two years in US dollar terms.
*   **CBIOs (Decarbonization Credits):** Average CBIO trading prices are at their lowest levels since 2022. On June 13, 2025, the average Cbio price was R59.30 ($10.70), its lowest since September 2022. On June 12, 2025, the price had recovered slightly, reaching R59.50.

**2. Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **Selic Rate:** On January 29, 2026, Brazil's Central Bank (Copom) maintained the Selic rate at 15% per year. This is the fifth consecutive meeting at which Copom has maintained the basic interest rate.
*   **Impact of Selic:** High interest rates are seen as an obstacle to short-term credit by 80% of industrial companies and to long-term financing by 71%. A Selic rate of 15% makes many construction projects unviable.
*   **IPCA (Inflation):** In 2025, the IPCA stood at 4.26 percent, the lowest annual level since 2018.

**3. Regulatory Actions:**

*   **ANP (Natural Gas):** On December 29, 2025, Brazil hydrocarbons regulator ANP approved a revised natural gas tariff regime that clarifies capacity contracting rules and establishes a stable pricing mechanism for entry-exit transport operators. ANP updated the methodology for calculating the WACC for the next regulatory cycle, which will govern returns on regulated investments from 2026 to 2030.
*   **ANP (Biofuels):** Since December 2023, only domestically produced biodiesel has been allowed for meeting Brazil's biofuel blending mandate.
*   **Central Bank:** In January 2026, the Central Bank updated minimum regulatory capital requirements with a new modular methodology and transition timeline.

**4. Global Correlation:**

*   **US Fed Rates:** Expectations of steady U.S. interest rates are likely to sustain Treasury yields and favor the dollar globally. A potential rhetorical opening for the start of Brazil's Selic rate cut cycle as early as March could lower expectations for the Brazilian interest rate differential, reducing the relative attractiveness of domestic assets and putting depreciation pressure on the real.
*   **US Tariffs:** Increased trade barriers with the US may impact Brazil. If a 50% tariff scenario becomes long-lasting, with an effective tariff of around 40%, Brazil's GDP could potentially be reduced by 0.6% to 1.0%, though this impact could be mitigated by diversifying exports to other countries.
*   **China:** China's economic activity and trade policies can affect commodity prices, influencing Brazil's export revenue.

**Additional Points:**

*   **Market Size:** The Brazil logistics market size in 2025 reached USD 127.0 Billion. It is expected to reach USD 176.7 Billion by 2034, exhibiting a growth rate (CAGR) of 3.74% during 2026-2034.
*   **Railway Investments:** The government aims for 8 railway auctions in 2026 with R$ 140 billion in investments.
*   **Port Growth:** Brazil's port sector saw 6% growth in 2024, with a 15% surge in container operations.
*   **Bio-LPG Production:** ANP granted the country's first authorizations for processing 100% renewable feedstock at a refining unit and for the commercialization of liquefied petroleum gas from renewable sources (Bio-LPG).
*   **Vale's Iron Ore Production:** Vale increased its iron ore production to 336mn t in 2025, up by 2.6pc compared with a year earlier.
