The fund manager updated the estimated monthly distribution to be between R$ 0.84 and R$ 0.90 per share until December 2026. An estimated cap rate of 7.3% is reported based on the NOI cash flow for the 12 months ending in April 2023, related to the sale of a stake in Villa Romana Shopping. The expectation is that the transaction generates a cap rate of 8.9% for the next 12 months, as well as a yield of 9.5%, taking into account only the portion that was paid in cash."
