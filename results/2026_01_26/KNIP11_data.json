  "investment_thesis": {
    "bull_case": "KNIP11 offers exposure to a well-diversified portfolio of real estate-related fixed income assets, particularly CRIs, with a target return of IMA-B plus 0.50% per year. The fund's large net worth, high allocation to target assets (103.1%), and attractive dividend yield (11.07% for the last 12 months) make it an appealing investment. BTG Pactual has a buy recommendation with a target price of R$ 95.00.",
    "bear_case": "The fund's exposure to CRIs and real estate ventures carries inherent risks. The management fee of 1.00% per year could impact returns. The fund's allocation to the office sector (31.8%) and shopping malls (31.2%) may be vulnerable to market fluctuations. Trading at R$ 92.40 with a book value per share of R$ 92.65 (P/VP of 0.99) suggests limited upside."
