Okay, I will analyze HGLG11 (CSHG Logística FII) to construct a bear case based on vacancy, leverage, valuation, and tenant concentration.

Here's a bear case analysis for HGLG11, addressing the specified objectives:

**1. Vacancy:**

*   **Physical Vacancy:** As of April 2025, HGLG11 had a vacancy rate of 5.5%. While this was below the sector average at the time, it was higher than some of its peers like BTLG11, which had a 1% vacancy rate. Certain properties within the HGLG11 portfolio have higher vacancy rates, such as São José dos Campos with almost 25% vacancy, DCR with 13%, and CL with 6.7%.
*   **Financial Vacancy:** In a video from November 2025, it was mentioned that HGLG11 had a financial vacancy of 3.1% and a physical vacancy of 2.8%.
*   **Vacancy Trends:** There were expectations of a potential increase in vacancy. Several tenants were expected to leave properties in November 2025, January 2026 and February 2026.

**Bear Case Implication:** An increase in vacancy would reduce the fund's rental income, negatively impacting its ability to distribute dividends. The fund's dividend yield has decreased in the last 3 years.

**2. Leverage:**

*   **Debt/CRI Obligations:** HGLG11 has CRI (Certificados de Recebíveis Imobiliários) obligations. A relevant level of leverage represents 12.1% of its equity.
*   **CRI GTIS:** The fund has a significant investment in CRI GTIS, accounting for almost R$410 million of its total equity.
*   **Debt Payment Correction:** Initially, there was an understanding that a large portion of the CRI GTIS debt was due in the short term, but this was later clarified. Only R$16.10 million is due in the next 12 months, with the remainder due later.

**Bear Case Implication:** While the short-term debt concerns were alleviated, the fund still carries debt obligations. High leverage can amplify losses if property values decline or vacancy increases.

**3. Valuation:**

*   **P/VP Ratio:** HGLG11 has a P/VP ratio of 0.94. A P/VP below 1 suggests the fund may be undervalued by the market.
*   **Historical P/VP:** HGLG11's P/VP ratio has fluctuated. In the past, it has traded at a premium (above 1.0), but currently trades below its book value.

**Bear Case Implication:** While a P/VP below 1 might seem positive, it could also indicate that the market has concerns about the fund's future performance or asset quality.

**4. Tenant Concentration:**

*   **Tenant Concentration:** Mercado Livre accounts for 14% of HGLG11's rental income.
*   **Major Tenants:** Other major tenants include Volkswagen, RMG, Electrolux, Shopee, Decathlon and Kremer.

**Bear Case Implication:** The fund has some reliance on Mercado Livre. If Mercado Livre were to leave, it would impact the fund's income and vacancy rates.

**Additional Bearish Points:**

*   **Merger Risks:** HGLG11 has a proposed merger with LVBI11 and PATL11. While this could create a larger and more liquid fund, there are risks associated with exchange ratios, dilution, portfolio integration, and governance.
*   **Dividend Sustainability:** There have been concerns about the sustainability of HGLG11's dividends, with the fund potentially using reserves to maintain payouts.
*   **Typical vs. Atypical Contracts:** A higher percentage of typical contracts (75%) compared to atypical contracts (25%) may indicate less predictability and security in rental income. Atypical contracts offer more security due to heavy fines if a tenant decides to leave.
*   **Geographic Concentration:** A significant portion of the fund's rental income comes from São Paulo (68.8%) and Minas Gerais (14.2%). Economic downturns in these regions could disproportionately affect the fund.
*   **Decreasing Dividend Yield:** HGLG11's dividend yield has decreased over the last 3 years.

This analysis provides a comprehensive bear case for HGLG11, highlighting potential risks and weaknesses based on the available information.
