*   **Hybrid Strategy:** MXRF11 uses a hybrid strategy with exposure to development-linked structures and secondary market trades.
*   **Exposure to other FIIs and Permutas:** The fund allocates up to 20% of its NAV to high-yield real estate-linked financial swaps (permutas financeiras) and selected FII positions.
