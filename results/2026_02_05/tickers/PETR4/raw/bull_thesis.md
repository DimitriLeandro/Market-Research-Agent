## PETR4 Bull Case: Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. Petrobras

Here's a structured investment thesis advocating a "buy" recommendation for PETR4:

### 1. Competitive Moat: Cost Advantage and Technological Expertise

*   **Low-Cost Production:** Petrobras benefits from substantial pre-salt oil reserves, characterized by high-quality light crude oil and remarkably low lifting costs. This provides a durable competitive advantage in the global energy market.
*   **Deepwater Expertise:** Decades of pioneering deepwater exploration have cultivated unmatched operational capabilities, positioning Petrobras as the natural operator for these complex reservoirs. The company has drilled nearly 3,000 wells in challenging offshore environments over almost 70 years without significant environmental incidents.
*   **Technological Innovation:** Petrobras possesses proprietary technologies, such as HISEP for CO2 separation, enhancing operational efficiency and environmental performance in complex E&P activities.
*   **Government Backing:** As a majority state-owned entity, Petrobras benefits from government backing and alignment with national energy strategies, ensuring capital for strategic projects.

### 2. Growth: Capex Projects and Expected Returns

*   **Increased Capital Expenditure:** Petrobras is increasing its capital expenditure, with investments in Q3 2025 up 24% year-over-year, focusing on pre-salt production.
*   **Strategic Plan 2024-2028:** Petrobras' Strategic Plan 2024-2028 involves a planned investment of US$102 billion, exceeding the previous plan by 31%. Approximately 67% of the E&P CAPEX will be allocated to pre-salt.
*   **Búzios Field Development:** The Búzios field reached a daily record of 1 million barrels of oil equivalent, representing 28% of Petrobras' oil production in Q3 2025. Petrobras plans for Búzios to account for 36% of its oil production by 2030, reaching 2 million barrels per day.
*   **Capex Allocation:** For 2026 and 2027, Petrobras expects to invest US$19.6 billion and US$19.5 billion, respectively, with exploration and production accounting for 78% of the total.
*   **IRR:** A previous analysis showed a nominal IRR for equity of approximately 26%.

### 3. Valuation: Undervalued Relative to Peers

*   **P/E Ratio:** PETR4's Price-To-Earnings Ratio (6.2x) is favorable compared to the peer average (31.3x).
*   **EV/EBITDA:** As of January 30, 2026, the EV/EBITDA ratio for PETR4 is 3.8, which is in line with the industry median. A previous analysis in December 2021 indicated that Petrobras traded at 2.5x EV/EBITDA NTM, against 3.4x for Russian O&G companies and 4.0x for major western O&G companies.
*   **Relative Valuation:** A relative valuation suggests that PETR4 is undervalued by 20%, with a fair value of R$46.15 compared to a market price of R$37.11.
*   **Discounted Cash Flow:** Trading below future cash flow value, suggesting it is undervalued.

### 4. Catalysts: Upcoming Events and Strategic Developments

*   **New FPSO Operations:** New FPSO operations in strategic fields may significantly boost production and future revenue streams.
*   **Strategic Plan Implementation:** Successful execution of the 2024-2028 Strategic Plan, with its focus on pre-salt and energy transition projects, could drive a re-rating.
*   **Exploration Success:** Continued exploration success, particularly in the Equatorial Margin and Southeast Basins, could unlock further value.
*   **Dividend Potential:** If the company continues to operate as it has in the past, dividends from 2022-2026 could amount to approximately 100% of the current market cap.

### Risks

*   **Political Intervention:** As a state-controlled company, Petrobras remains susceptible to political intervention, which could impact fuel pricing policies and capital allocation.
*   **Commodity Price Volatility:** Fluctuations in global oil prices can significantly impact Petrobras' revenue and profitability.

### Conclusion

Petrobras presents a compelling investment opportunity. The company's competitive advantages, driven by its low-cost pre-salt production and deepwater expertise, combined with substantial growth investments and an attractive valuation, create a strong bull case. While political risks remain a concern, the potential upside from strategic plan execution and continued operational success outweighs these risks, making PETR4 a buy.
