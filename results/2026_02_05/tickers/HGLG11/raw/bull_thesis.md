Okay, I will construct a bull case for HGLG11, considering its portfolio quality, yield, valuation, and contracts.

Here's a bull case for HGLG11, based on the objectives:

**Bull Case: HGLG11 (CSHG Logística FII)**

*   **Portfolio Quality:** HGLG11 invests in logistics and industrial properties. The fund strategically acquires land for construction or existing properties for lease, sale, or leaseback. HGLG11's portfolio includes properties in prime regions such as RJ, SP, and MG. The fund has tenants like Arezzo, Whirpool and Suzano. Vacancy is relatively low, at 2.40%.

*   **Yield:** HGLG11 has a dividend yield of approximately 8.40%. The fund distributes dividends monthly. The fund has consistently distributed an average of R$1.10 per share monthly since August 2021. The fund's distributions are tax-exempt for individual investors, increasing the net return.

*   **Valuation:** HGLG11 has a P/VP ratio of 0.94. A P/VP below 1 suggests the fund may be undervalued compared to its net asset value.

**Additional factors:**

*   **Experienced Management:** HGLG11 is managed by Pátria Investimentos, a well-known manager.
*   **Merger Potential:** There was a potential merger involving HGLG11, LVBI11 and PATL11 which could increase scale and liquidity.

*   **Consistent Distributions:** HGLG11 aims to distribute at least 95% of its earnings based on semi-annual balance sheets, with monthly advances.

**In summary,** HGLG11 presents a compelling bull case due to its quality portfolio, consistent yield, potential undervaluation, and long-term contracts.
