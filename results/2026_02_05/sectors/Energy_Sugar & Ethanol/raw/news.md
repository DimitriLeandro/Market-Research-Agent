Okay, I will compile a chronological list of recent news and events affecting the Brazilian Energy/Sugar & Ethanol sector, focusing on M&A activity, legislation, global events, and supply chain disruptions.

Here's a chronological summary of events impacting the Brazilian Energy/Sugar & Ethanol sector:

**2025**

*   **May 13, 2025:** Brazil and China signed an ethanol cooperation agreement to expand Brazil's ethanol exports to China, as China prepares to implement its E10 gasoline policy. The agreement also covers sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), marine fuel alternatives, and ethanol as a raw material for bioplastics.
*   **May 14, 2025:** The National Corn Ethanol Union (UNEM) announced that at least ten new plants are under construction in Brazil, expected to be operational between 2025 and 2027. These plants aim to meet the growing international demand for ethanol and DDGs (Dried Distillers Grains with Solubles). Brazilian DDG production could reach 5 million tons in the 2025/2026 harvest.
*   **July 31, 2025:** The US planned a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods, including ethanol, but market participants did not expect a major domestic impact because Brazil exports little ethanol to the US compared with its output.
*   **September 3, 2025:** The European Commission adopted proposals for Council decisions on the signature and conclusion of the EU-Mercosur Partnership Agreement (EMPA) and the interim Trade Agreement (iTA).
*   **October 17, 2025:** Sugarcane production in the Center-South of Brazil is expected to end with a crushing of 596.97 million tons, a 4% drop compared to the previous cycle, while ethanol production shows a more significant reduction.
*   **November 4, 2025:** Conab, Brazil's crop forecasting agency, raised its Brazil 2025/26 sugar production estimate to 45 MMT from a previous forecast of 44.5 MMT.
*   **November 11, 2025:** The India Sugar Mill Association (ISMA) raised its 2025/26 India sugar production estimate to 31 MMT from an earlier forecast of 30 MMT.
*   **November 17, 2025:** The International Sugar Organization (ISO) forecast a 1.625 million MT sugar surplus in 2025-26.
*   **November 19, 2025:** China's sugar imports jumped 39% in October, with Brazilian sugar exports to China surging roughly 58% year-on-year.
*   **December 10, 2025:** Heavy rainfall in Northeast Brazil delayed harvesting and milling, limiting the redirection of sugarcane to sugar production. Some producers in Paraíba plan to increase ethanol production in anticipation of improved prices by May 2026.
*   **December 12, 2025:** Covrig Analytics raised its 2025/26 global sugar surplus estimate to 4.7 MMT from 4.1 MMT in October.
*   **December 16, 2025:** Falling sugar and ethanol prices are expected to squeeze margins for Brazilian cane mills in the 2026/27 season. International sugar prices have fallen about 28% over the past 12 months, hitting around 14 cents a pound.
*   **December 23, 2025:** Consulting firm Safras & Mercado said that Brazil's sugar production in 2026/27 will fall by -3.91% to 41.8 MMT from 43.5 MMT expected in 2025/26.

**2026**

*   **January 17, 2026:** Representatives of the EU and Mercosur convened in Asunción for the formal signing ceremony of the EU-Mercosur Agreement. The agreement includes tariff liberalization and increased import quotas for sensitive goods, including sugar and ethanol.
*   **January 21, 2026:** Unica reported that Brazil's cumulative 2025-26 Center-South sugar output through December rose by +0.9% y/y to 40.222 MMT.
*   **January 27, 2026:** Sugar prices increased due to a rally in the Brazilian real, which discourages exports.
*   **January 28, 2026:** The EU-Mercosur Agreement's extensive tariff-liberalisation schedule will reduce tariffs on 91% of EU exports and remove tariffs on 92% of Mercosur exports.
*   **January 29, 2026:** Green Pool Commodity Specialists said they expect a 2.74 MMT global sugar surplus for 2025/26 and a 156,000 MT surplus for 2026/27.
*   **February 2, 2026:** Sugar prices extended their week-long plunge due to the outlook for global sugar surpluses and higher global sugar production. The USDA predicted that Brazil's 2025/26 sugar production would rise by 2.3% y/y to a record 44.7 MMT.
*   **February 3, 2026:** Brazil's sugarcane processors have fallen behind in hedging their output for the 2026/27 season and are expected to shift more cane toward ethanol production as sugar prices remain below production costs. Czarnikow lowered its estimate for the share of sugarcane used to produce sugar to 48.3%, reducing sugar output in the center-south region by about 700,000 tonnes. Brazil is expanding second-generation ethanol (E2G) production with several advanced biofuel plants being developed.
*   **February 4, 2026:** Healthy ethanol prices, expansion of corn ethanol plants, and an expected large sugarcane crop will lead to a jump in Brazil's ethanol output in 2026. Rabobank projects more than 3 billion liters of additional corn ethanol capacity will come online in 2026.
*   **February 5, 2026:** The Mercosur–EU deal, signed on January 17, promises expanded export access for Brazilian agribusiness, although the implementation timeline is uncertain.

**Key Trends and Issues:**

*   **Ethanol Expansion:** Brazil is expanding its ethanol production capacity, particularly corn-based ethanol and second-generation ethanol.
*   **Sugar Market Dynamics:** Global sugar prices are under pressure due to expected surpluses and increased production in India and Thailand. Brazilian mills may shift production towards ethanol due to low sugar prices.
*   **Trade Agreements:** The EU-Mercosur agreement is expected to impact trade flows, with increased quotas for sugar and ethanol exports to the EU.
*   **China's Influence:** China is a major buyer of Brazilian sugar and has signed an agreement to increase ethanol imports, impacting demand and investment in the sector.
*   **US Tariffs:** US tariffs on Brazilian goods, including ethanol, could impact trade flows, although the immediate domestic impact is expected to be limited.
*   **Policy and Mandates:** Brazil's "Fuel of the Future" program increases the anhydrous blend in gasoline, potentially shifting supply from hydrous to anhydrous ethanol.
*   **Production Estimates:** Various agencies and consultancies have provided updated estimates for sugar and ethanol production in Brazil, with some anticipating a decline in sugar production in the 2026/27 season.
*   **Hedging:** Brazilian sugarcane processors have fallen behind in hedging their output for the 2026/27 season.
