Okay, I will compile a chronological list of recent news and events affecting the Brazilian Energy/Sugar & Ethanol sector, focusing on M&A activity, legislation, global events, and supply chain disruptions.

Here's a chronological summary of recent events impacting the Brazilian Energy/Sugar & Ethanol sector:

**2025**

*   **2025-01-03:** President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva enacted Law 15.082/2024, which guarantees sugarcane producers a share of revenues from trading Decarbonization Credits (CBIOs). The law amends the National Biofuels Policy (RenovaBio) to include independent sugarcane producers and also revises Law 9.478/1997 to strengthen sector regulations, including increased fines for unmet decarbonization targets.
*   **2025-07-21:** A StoneX analysis indicated that proposed U.S. tariffs could impact Brazilian sugar and ethanol exports. While a 50% tariff might decrease import volumes, some U.S. buyers would likely continue purchasing Brazilian sugarcane ethanol due to its lower carbon emissions. High U.S. stock levels were expected to cushion the short-term impact.
*   **2025-08-01:** The mandatory blending rate for anhydrous ethanol in gasoline increased from 27% to 30%. Experts estimate that the new blend will consume an additional 1 billion liters per year.
*   **2025-10-17:** The 2025/26 sugarcane harvest in the Center-South of Brazil was expected to close at 596.97 million tons, a 4% drop compared to the previous cycle, with a more significant reduction in ethanol production.
*   **2025-12-10:** The sugar and ethanol sector in Northeast Brazil faced challenges due to falling sugar prices, US tariff increases, high production costs, and unfavorable weather.
*   **2025-12-16:** A potential slump in sugar and ethanol prices threatened Brazilian cane mills' margins for the 2026/27 season, with international sugar prices having fallen about 28% over the past 12 months. Falling oil prices and a growing supply of corn-based ethanol were also weighing on prices.
*   **2025-12-19:** EPE (Brazil's Energy Research Office) published its December 2025 Short-Term Fuel Market Outlook, forecasting an increase in Brazilian liquid fuel and LPG demand by 3.6 billion liters in 2025 and 3.0 billion liters in 2026. The report cited favorable economic conditions and government programs as drivers for growth.
*   **2025:** Brazilian ethanol exports contracted to around 1.7 billion liters, a 9% drop from 2024, due to strong domestic demand and low inventories. Internal consumption reached about 19 billion liters of hydrated ethanol and 13 billion liters of anhydrous ethanol.

**2026**

*   **2026-01-01:** Ethanol inventories at mills in Brazil's Center-South region totaled 7.07 billion liters, a 19.7% decrease compared to the same period in 2025.
*   **2026-02-02:** Ethanol and sugar were driving Brazilian agribusiness.
*   **2026-02-03:** Brazil was expanding its second-generation ethanol (E2G) production with advanced biofuel plants.
*   **2026-02-04:** Analysts at the Dubai Sugar Conference indicated that healthy ethanol prices, expansion of corn ethanol plants, and an expected large sugarcane crop would lead to a jump in Brazil's ethanol output in 2026. Sugarcane mills were expected to switch to producing more ethanol due to low global sugar prices.
*   **2026-02-05:** StoneX estimated Brazil's combined cane and corn ethanol production would grow 7.9% in 2026/2027 (April-March) to 36.5 billion liters, with cane ethanol up 4.4% and corn ethanol up 17%.

**Ongoing Trends & Systemic Issues:**

*   **US Tariffs:** US tariff policies continue to pose a threat to Brazilian sugar and ethanol exports, particularly in the Northeast region.
*   **Ethanol Mandates:** Brazil's increasing ethanol blending mandates are expected to boost domestic demand for ethanol.
*   **Corn Ethanol Expansion:** The growth of corn ethanol production is changing the dynamics of the Brazilian ethanol market, potentially leading to increased competition in the North-Northeast regions.
*   **Sugar Prices:** Low global sugar prices are incentivizing mills to shift production towards ethanol.
*   **EU-Mercosur Trade Deal:** The EU-Mercosur trade deal has the potential to change trade flows for Brazilian ethanol.
*   **RenovaBio:** The RenovaBio program and associated CBIOs are increasingly important, with recent legislation ensuring sugarcane producers benefit.
*   **Production Costs:** Higher production costs in the Northeast region compared to the Center-South region create competitive disadvantages.
*   **Hedging:** Brazilian sugarcane producers have been slow to hedge for the 2026/27 season, which will begin in April.
*   **Demand:** Brazilian liquid fuel and LPG demand is forecast to increase in 2025 and 2026.
*   **Inventories:** Ethanol inventories at mills in Brazil's Center-South region fell.
