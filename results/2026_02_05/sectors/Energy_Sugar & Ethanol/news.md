Okay, I will compile a chronological list of recent news and events affecting the Brazilian Energy/Sugar & Ethanol sector, focusing on M&A activity, legislation, global events, and supply chain disruptions.

Here's a chronological summary of recent events impacting the Brazilian Energy/Sugar & Ethanol sector:

**2025**

*   **January 3:** Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva enacted Law 15.082/2024, ensuring sugarcane producers receive a share of revenues from trading Decarbonization Credits (CBIOs). The law amends the National Biofuels Policy (RenovaBio), which previously limited CBIO revenues to ethanol-producing mills, to include independent sugarcane producers. The law also increases fines for unmet decarbonization targets, classifying them as environmental crimes.
*   **May 30:** China and Brazil reached an ethanol cooperation agreement to expand Brazil's ethanol exports to China, as China prepares to implement its E10 gasoline policy. The agreement includes a bilateral working group to explore the development and technological innovation of first- and second-generation ethanol, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), marine fuel alternatives, and ethanol's use as a raw material for bioplastics.
*   **July 15:** The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) initiated an investigation into Brazil's unfair trading practices, including those impacting ethanol market access. The investigation aims to determine whether Brazil's acts, policies, and practices related to ethanol market access are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce.
*   **July 21:** A StoneX Brazil Market Intelligence Analyst discussed the potential impact of possible 50% U.S. tariffs on Brazilian sugar and ethanol, noting that the U.S. could face its own supply challenges. Brazilian sugarcane ethanol has lower carbon emissions compared to U.S. corn ethanol.
*   **July 23:** The Brazilian government increased the required ethanol blend in gasoline from 27% to 30%. This change necessitates over 1 billion additional liters of ethanol annually. Corn ethanol production has become essential to meeting the rising demand for renewable fuel.
*   **July 31:** A planned 50% tariff by the U.S. on Brazilian goods was projected to have little effect on Brazil's ethanol market, but any Brazilian response could curtail the large volumes of U.S. ethanol Brazil expected to import.
*   **September 3:** The U.S. ethanol industry requested the U.S. government to fight Brazil's "unfair" trade practices, including an 18% tariff on imports of corn-based ethanol from the U.S. since 2020.
*   **September 11:** The Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) outlined the harmful impacts of Brazil's trade policies on the U.S. ethanol industry and called for actions to level the playing field. U.S. ethanol exports to Brazil have dropped from $761 million in 2018 to $53 million in 2024.
*   **October 3:** The Sugar and Alcohol Exporters Association (Aexa) warned that inadequate infrastructure and taxation are undermining the product's competitiveness in international markets, despite the Port of Santos leading sugar exports.
*   **October 25:** A boom in corn ethanol production in Brazil is driving global sugar prices lower. Sugar-cane processors are diverting a record share of their crop to sugar production due to competition from cheaper corn-based biofuel.
*   **October 27:** Analysts expect Brazil to produce a record 43 million metric tons of sugar from next year's crop, up 4.6% from the previous season. Corn-based output is forecast to account for 32% of Brazil's fuel ethanol production in the season starting in April, up from 23% currently.
*   **November 18:** Brazil launched a new subcommittee to coordinate studies and propose measures aimed at enabling higher blends of biodiesel and ethanol, with the goal of increasing the ethanol blend rate to up to 35% and the biodiesel blend rate to up to 20%.
*   **November 19:** China's sugar imports jumped 39% in October, with Brazil being the primary beneficiary. Brazilian sugar exports to China in October surged roughly 58% year-on-year.
*   **December 10:** The sugar and ethanol sector in the Northeast of Brazil began the 2025/26 harvest facing a challenging scenario due to falling sugar prices, U.S. tariff increases, high production costs, and unfavorable weather.
*   **December 16:** Brazil's sugar-and-ethanol mills are facing a reversal that is set to squeeze margins in the 2026/27 season, as international sugar prices have fallen about 28% over the past 12 months.

**2026**

*   **January 28:** A Free Trade Agreement between the EU and Mercosur includes increased import quotas for sensitive goods, including sugar and ethanol, creating both market opportunities and competitive pressures for agriculture operators.
*   **February 3:** Brazil's sugarcane processors have fallen behind in hedging their output for the 2026/27 season and are expected to shift more cane toward ethanol production as sugar prices remain below production costs.

**Ongoing Issues:**

*   **Financial Distress:** Nearly a quarter of Brazil's sugar mills are in financial distress, with many either bankrupt or undergoing judicial recovery.
*   **Logistical Bottlenecks:** Brazil's main ports have experienced logistical difficulties shipping sugar since October 2023, with long vessel waiting times, especially in the port of Santos. A historic drought in the Amazon region has exacerbated the issue.
*   **Competition for Logistics:** Sugar and grain compete for logistics in Center-South Brazil, which can limit sugar export flow and increase truck freights.

This compilation provides a comprehensive overview of the key events and issues impacting the Brazilian Energy/Sugar & Ethanol sector.
