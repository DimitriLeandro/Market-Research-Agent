Okay, I understand. I will compile a chronological list of recent news and events affecting the Hybrid/Paper sector in Brazil, focusing on M&A activity, legislation, global events, and supply chain disruptions.

Here's a chronological list of recent news and events affecting the Hybrid/Paper sector in Brazil:

**2025**

*   **(2025-01-03)** A gradual recovery of the M&A market in Brazil is expected in 2025, with strategic sectors like technology, healthcare, and renewable energy likely to remain key destinations for capital. Macroeconomic stabilization and effective implementation of tax reform could create a more predictable and investment-friendly environment.
*   **(2025-04-17)** M&A activity in Brazil showed early signs of growth, with PWC Brazil reporting 99 M&A transactions in January 2025, a 16% increase compared to the same period in 2024. The majority of these transactions are local, involving Brazilian entities acquiring other entities in Brazil. PWC Brazil expects the number of M&A transactions in the country in 2025 to be higher than the number of M&A transactions in 2023 by 10% to 20%, mainly driven by strategic acquisitions and restructuring opportunities.
*   **(2025-07-15)** Graphic paper prices in Brazil fell in June-July amid growing uncertainty and increasing pessimism regarding government demand in the second half of 2025, mainly due to concerns about the country's National Textbook Program (PNLD). The PNLD accounts for approximately 180,000 tonnes per year of graphic paper consumption.
*   **(2025-07-15)** The announcement of a new 50% tariff imposed on all Brazilian imports entering the US market from August 1, 2025, added uncertainty for forest-based companies already struggling with demand.
*   **(2025-07-26)** Closer ties with China and participation in the Digital Silk Road (DSR) could negatively impact Brazil's relationship with the United States, so Brazil should seek to balance its cooperation with China while maintaining its relationship with Washington.
*   **(2025-10-27)** Brazil introduced legislation requiring companies to participate in a reverse logistics system for plastics packaging from January 2026. Decree Number 12,688 requires market operators to meet a recycled content target of 22% and a recovery rate of 32% in 2026.
*   **(2025-11-04)** The Brazilian mergers and acquisitions (M&A) market experienced a robust rebound in 2025. Through August 2025, Brazil recorded about 1,142 transactions totaling roughly BRL 187.8 billion—a 33% increase versus the same period in 2024.
*   **(2025-12-02)** Global goods-trade imbalances are stabilizing but remain high. China's goods surplus narrowed in the third quarter of 2025, but it was still about $30 billion higher than in the third quarter of 2024. The United States' overall trade deficit also narrowed, improving compared with both the second and third quarters of 2025.
*   **(2025-12-19)** Brazil's Congress approved Complementary Bill No. 128/2025, introducing mandatory reductions in federal tax incentives and increasing the withholding tax rate on Interest on Net Equity (INE) to 17.5%, effective from 1 January 2026. The bill introduces a 10% cut in federal tax incentives, phasing in between 2025 and 2026, and new benefits will only be granted if offset by equivalent compensatory measures, affecting companies reliant on special regimes.

**2026**

*   **(2026-01-05)** China's deflationary spiral presents near-term inflation benefits but brings medium-term vulnerabilities in commodity-dependent exports.
*   **(2026-01-06)** ResourceWise predicted that Chinese overcapacity and exports will reshape global trade and pricing, driving additional protectionist actions in regions with significant pulp and paper manufacturing, such as Europe, India, and possibly Brazil. Chinese exports of pulp and paper will weaken global prices as they make inroads into India and Brazil.
*   **(2026-01-12)** Cyber-attacks on logistics, including ports, carriers, and 3PLs, are a major concern in 2026. Everstream Analytics data shows that there was a 61% surge in cyber-attacks on logistics in 2025.
*   **(2026-01-13)** A potential risk for 2026 is supply chain fragility in Brazil due to financial and operational issues within farms, intermediaries, logistics providers and financing structures.
*   **(2026-01-15)** Trade between Brazil and China hit a record US$171 billion in 2025, more than double Brazil's total with the United States last year. US tariffs on Brazilian exports nudged Brasilia to deepen ties with Beijing.
*   **(2026-01-16)** The energy and natural resources sector (including pulp and paper) accounted for more than 50% of the total value transacted in M&A transactions in Brazil in 2025 (over US$ 30 billion).
*   **(2026-01-25)** The Brazilian packaging market is expected to reach approximately US$40.12 billion in 2026, driven by the expansion of e-commerce and the search for more sustainable solutions, such as paper and cardboard packaging. Studies indicate that the paper packaging segment maintains a consistent growth outlook in the coming years, with annual rates exceeding 5%, supported by the replacement of plastic packaging and increased logistics demand.
*   **(2026-01-29)** Most advisors foresee little to no change in M&A multiples in 2026.
*   **(2026-01-30)** Supply chains shouldn't expect to settle into a period of calm in 2026. Trade uncertainty will continue to plague supply chains this year, but retailers and manufacturers will also contend with plenty of other challenges, including supply constraints on key materials such as semiconductors and beef, operational cost pressures, and questions about logistics reliability.

**Ongoing Trends and Considerations:**

*   **M&A Activity:** M&A activity in Brazil rebounded in 2025, with expectations of continued growth in 2026. The energy and natural resources sector, including pulp and paper, is a significant driver of M&A value.
*   **Legislation:** New legislation mandates reverse logistics systems for plastic packaging starting in January 2026, with increasing targets for recycled content and recovery rates. Congress approved a bill reducing federal tax incentives and increasing taxation of certain industries and instruments, effective in 2026.
*   **Global Events:** Trade relations between Brazil, China, and the US are significantly impacting the sector. US tariffs have led Brazil to deepen ties with China, which has increased demand for Brazilian goods. Chinese overcapacity in pulp and paper is expected to put downward pressure on global prices.
*   **Supply Chain:** Supply chain fragility due to financial and operational issues is a potential risk. Cyber-attacks on logistics are a growing concern.
