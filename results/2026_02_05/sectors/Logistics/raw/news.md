Okay, I will compile a chronological list of recent news and events affecting the Logistics sector in Brazil, focusing on M&A activity, new legislation, the impact of global events, and supply chain disruptions.

Here's a chronological overview of the key events and trends impacting the Logistics sector in Brazil:

**2025**

*   **January-June 2025:** M&A activity in Brazil reached $29 billion, a 40% increase compared to the same period in 2024, although the number of deals decreased from 432 to 322. Energy, oil and gas, pulp and paper, and mining sectors accounted for 60% of the total volume.
*   **March 2025:** Logistical bottlenecks caused Brazil to fail to ship over 600,000 bags of coffee, resulting in approximately $1.57 million in losses. Inefficiencies at major coffee-exporting ports led to an additional $11.72 million in extra costs since June 2024. 55% of vessels experienced delays or schedule alterations at Brazil's main ports.
*   **April 2025:** The US imposed a 10% reciprocal tariff on Brazil.
*   **May 2025:** Bottlenecks in Brazilian ports became a critical obstacle for the agribusiness sector, impacting key supply chains. Brazil invested only 2.2% of its GDP in infrastructure in 2024, while nearly double that amount would be required to meet projected demand.
*   **May 14, 2025:** Supply chain warning was issued regarding Brazilian port bottlenecks, which were impacting key supply chains of major industries and commodities exports.
*   **May 15, 2025:** China accounted for 44% of Brazil's oil exports in 2024. From January to March 2025, China received approximately 40% of Brazil's quarterly oil exports.

*   **October 27, 2025:** New Brazilian law mandates a reverse logistics system for plastic packaging from January 2026, with targets for 22% recycled content and a 32% recovery rate.
*   **November 13, 2025:** Brazil is expected to see double-digit rent growth for the fourth consecutive year, and vacancy in key Prologis markets has declined to a decade low.
*   **November 18, 2025:** A one-year deal between China and the United States may have temporarily cooled trade tensions, but it has not resolved the deeper rivalry shaping global supply chains.
*   **December 2025:** Transportation and logistics M&A moved into a more disciplined, selective phase.

**2026**

*   **January 5, 2026:** Ordinance GM/MMA No. 1,560 was published, establishing guidelines for reverse logistics systems for electronic products and their components for domestic use. Ordinance GM/MMA No. 1,561 was published, amending Ordinance No. 1,102/2024 to regulate provisions of Decree No. 11,413/2023, defining criteria for the qualification of management entities and parameters for their performance in reverse logistics systems for packaging in general.
*   **January 6, 2026:** Data showed Brazilian exports surged to record levels in 2025, reaching $348.7 billion, a 3.5% increase from 2024.
*   **January 13, 2026:** Supply chain fragility in Brazil is a real risk, with financial and operational vulnerabilities accumulating within farms, intermediaries, logistics providers, and financing structures.
*   **January 14, 2026:** Transportation and logistics M&A had clearly moved out of its post-pandemic correction and into a more disciplined, selective phase.
*   **January 23, 2026:** In 2025, M&A activity in Brazil registered 1,341 transactions, reflecting a 5.9% decrease compared with the same period of 2024, when 1,426 transactions were recorded.

*   **February 1, 2026:** Brazil will enforce new biofouling regulations under NORMAM-401, introducing stricter compliance requirements for vessels calling Brazilian ports.
*   **February 2, 2026:** New regulations broaden reverse logistics materials and define clearer accreditation criteria for entities and verifiers.
*   **February 4-5, 2026:** Brazilian crude exporters are working to address bottlenecks that are becoming overburdened by the country's surging exports. Brazil's crude production climbed by 12% year over year to 3.77mn b/d in 2025 and is expected to rise further this year.

**Ongoing Trends and Systemic Issues:**

*   **M&A Activity:** While overall M&A activity in Brazil saw a decrease in the number of transactions in 2025 compared to 2024, the value of deals increased significantly in the first half of the year, driven by large transactions in the energy and natural resources sectors. The transportation and logistics sector is seeing a recalibration with more selective and purposeful dealmaking.
*   **Port Bottlenecks and Infrastructure:** Brazilian ports are facing significant challenges due to outdated equipment, lack of maintenance, and underinvestment, leading to delays and increased costs, particularly for agribusiness exports. There is an urgent need to expand and modernize ports and invest in alternative logistics solutions.
*   **Reverse Logistics:** Brazil is expanding its reverse logistics requirements, particularly for plastic packaging and electronic products, with new laws and ordinances mandating participation in reverse logistics systems and setting targets for recycling and recovery rates.
*   **US-China Trade Dynamics:** The trade tensions between the US and China continue to impact Brazil, with China increasing its investment in Brazil as the US imposes tariffs. Brazil is seeking to diversify its trade and strengthen economic ties with China, particularly in the oil sector.
*   **Supply Chain Fragility:** Financial and operational vulnerabilities within Brazil's agricultural supply chain are a growing concern, with increasing defaults and credit tightening in the agribusiness sector.
