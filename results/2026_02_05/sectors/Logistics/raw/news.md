Okay, I will compile a chronological list of recent news and events affecting the Logistics sector in Brazil, focusing on M&A activity, legislation, global events impacting the sector, and supply chain disruptions.

Here's a chronological list of events and news affecting the Logistics sector in Brazil:

This decree sets forth criteria for structuring, implementing, and operating the reverse-logistics system for plastic packaging.
*   **2025-11-11:** The freight environment heading into 2026 is facing a tight economic climate, rising risk, and intensifying regulatory pressure. High-value and high-risk goods are surging across global and regional supply chains, particularly in Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia.

*   **2025-12-19:** Brazilian exports to China increased by 28.6% from August to November compared to the same period in 2024, offsetting the decline caused by US tariffs on Brazilian sales, which fell by 25.1%.
