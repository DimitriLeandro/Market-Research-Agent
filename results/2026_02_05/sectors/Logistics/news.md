Okay, I will compile a chronological list of recent news and events affecting the Logistics sector in Brazil, focusing on M&A activity, legislation, global events impacting the sector, and supply chain disruptions.

Here's a chronological summary of events impacting the Logistics sector in Brazil:

*   **November 2025:** Airfreight volumes from China bound for the US fell by 5% year-on-year, while Hong Kong-US flows dropped by 14%. This shift was driven by rising tariffs on Chinese goods and the removal of de minimis exemptions, leading US importers to seek alternative sourcing across Asia.
*   **December 2025:** The Port of Paranaguá in Brazil experienced elevated waiting times due to congestion.
*   **December 2025:** Mining, energy, and infrastructure segments in Brazil were expected to generate major M&A deals throughout 2026, amid optimistic expectations and growing investor interest.
