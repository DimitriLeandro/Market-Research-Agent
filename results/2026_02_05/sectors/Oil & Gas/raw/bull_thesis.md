Okay, I will construct a bull case for the Oil & Gas sector in Brazil, focusing on positive drivers and using hard data where available.

Here's a Bull Case for the Oil & Gas sector in Brazil:

**Overall Outlook:** Brazil is expected to be a primary growth engine in oil production in 2026, with production exceeding 4.2 million bpd, driven by the cost competitiveness and resilience of its pre-salt developments. Latin America's oil production is expected to exceed 8.8 million bpd this year, with Brazil being a major contributor. Brazil reached a historic milestone in oil and natural gas production in 2025, recording its highest annual output ever.

**1. Growth Drivers (Expanding TAM):**

*   **Increased Production:** Average daily production of oil and natural gas combined climbed to 4.897 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2025, a 13% increase compared to 2023. Output also rose by more than 13% year-on-year from 2024, confirming a sustained growth trend. In December 2025, combined oil and gas production rose to 5.237 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, the highest monthly level on record. Crude oil output exceeded 4 million barrels per day, while natural gas production approached 195 million cubic meters per day in December 2025.
*   **Pre-Salt Dominance:** The pre-salt reserves are the central engine of Brazilian energy, responsible for 79.63% of all oil and gas production nationally throughout 2025. This highlights the technological efficiency applied in deep and ultra-deep maritime operations. Pre-salt output in December 2025 represented almost 80% of national production, with gains of more than 19% year on year.
*   **FPSO Vessels:** Brazil's production growth in 2026 is tied to new floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel ramp-ups and start-ups.
*   **Growing Fuel Demand:** Investments are expected to support Brazil's growing fuel demand as per capita income increases.
*   **Oil Exploration Auction:** Brazil is planning to auction exploration rights to 172 oil and gas blocks. This area is more than twice the size of Scotland and is key to Brazil's plans to become the world's fourth-largest oil producer.

**2. Macro Tailwinds:**

*   **Industrial Output Increase:** Brazil's 2025 industrial output reached a third increase in a row at 0.6% above a year earlier and pre-pandemic levels, following a 3.1% rise in 2024. Extraction and food industries were among the largest contributors to the increase, up by 4.9% and 1.5%, respectively.
*   **Gasoline Prices Increase:** Gasoline prices in Brazil increased to 1.22 USD/Liter in January 2026 from 1.12 USD/Liter in December 2025.
*   **Interest Rate:** Brazil's central bank maintained its benchmark rate at 15.00% in January, saying a prolonged hold is needed to keep inflation on a steady path toward the target amid elevated uncertainty. Inflation expectations stand at 4.0% for 2026 and 3.8% for 2027, and Copom projects inflation at 3.2% by the third quarter of 2027.

**3. Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Crude Oil Price Increase:** Crude oil's price has risen 10.36% over the past month.
*   **Energy Price Index Surge:** The energy price index surged by 12% in January 2026, driven by a 78.4% spike in U.S. natural gas prices and a 4.6% increase in crude oil.

**4. Regulatory Support:**

*   **New Gas Law:** The natural gas sector is in the midst of a structural transformation and evolved considerably after the promulgation of the New Gas Law.
*   **Petrobras Divestments:** Petrobras' refinery divestments have overcome necessary hurdles, resulting in the completion of the sale of four out of eight refineries. These divestments are expected to stimulate other market participants to invest in the modernization of these refineries, and also in new maritime terminals, pipelines and railways.

**In summary,** the Brazilian Oil & Gas sector is experiencing a period of growth driven by pre-salt production, increasing demand, and strategic investments. While global economic factors and domestic interest rates present challenges, the sector is positioned for continued expansion and profitability.
