Okay, I will compile a chronological list of recent news and events affecting the Oil & Gas sector in Brazil, focusing on M&A activity, legislation, global events impacting the sector, and supply chain disruptions.

Here's a chronological summary of recent news and events impacting the Brazilian Oil & Gas sector:

**M&A Activity:**

*   **2024:** There was a 62% growth in M&A deals in the oil and gas sector in Brazil. Small and medium-sized companies are driving this growth. One notable deal was the formation of Brava Energia, a combination of 3R Petroleum and Enauta. Brava Energia sold onshore assets to Azevedo & Travassos and Petro-Victory. Other companies involved in M&A operations include Perenco, Mandacaru Energia, Phoenix O&G, Petrorecôncavo, Qatar Energy, and Petrobras. Petro-Victory and BlueOak Investments acquired Capixaba Energia.
*   **Q3 2024:** M&A activity in Brazil increased by 134% compared to the previous quarter, and rose by 37029% compared to Q3 2023. Deal volume decreased by 50% compared to the previous quarter but was 50% higher than in Q3 2023.
*   **2025:** A diverse set of M&A themes played out across the energy and natural resources landscape, reflecting the unique set of opportunities and challenges facing each sector. The most compelling M&A moves across the energy and natural resources sectors took place in oil and gas, where large players and well-capitalized independents alike consolidated across upstream, midstream, and services.
*   **2025:** PRIO made two cross-border acquisitions for approximately $5.4 billion, involving the Peregrino and Pitangola oil fields in the Campos Basin. PRIO acquired Equinor's 60% stake for $3.5 billion and the transfer of operatorship of the assets. Previously, PRIO acquired Sinochem Petroleum Netherlands' 40% participating interest for $1.9 billion.
*   **2026 (Projected):** Mining, energy, and infrastructure segments in Brazil are expected to generate major M&A deals. Overall M&A activity in the country is expected to remain stable.

**Legislation:**

*   **April 2021:** Brazil's New Gas Law (Law No. 14.134/2021) was enacted, establishing a new legal framework to restructure the natural gas sector in Brazil. It aims to improve economic competitiveness, encourage new agents, promote market decentralization, foster new investments, reduce bureaucracy, and lower costs for consumers.
*   **August 2024:** Decree No. 12,153/24 further regulated Law No. 14,134/2021, amending Decree No. 10,712/21 (Gas Decree). The goals are to increase gas supply and increase governmental involvement in ensuring access to essential infrastructure by strengthening the powers of the ANP.
*   **February 2025:** The New Gas Law introduced innovations, including an authorization regime for new transportation pipelines, rules for third-party access to essential gas facilities, and de-verticalization between transportation companies and other segments.

**Global Events:**

*   **2025:** Chinese investments in Brazil grew 113% between 2023 and 2024. This reflects a broader expansion strategy in Latin America, including the megaproject of the port of Chancay in Peru.
*   **2026:** The US is tightening its stance on Iran and Venezuela, which could lead China to turn to higher-priced barrels from countries like Brazil.
*   **February 2026:** Rising volumes of heavy sour Venezuelan crude will not compete with Brazilian grades because they cater to different markets. Most of Brazil's exports will continue to go to Asia though the end of the decade.

**Supply Chain:**

*   **October 2025:** The Brazilian oil and gas regulator ANP stopped Refit from moving or blending any material in its Manguinhos refinery after finding irregularities. This led to anxieties about supply security in the Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo markets. Petrobras and other distributors stepped in to meet the demand.
*   **February 2026:** Brazilian crude exporters are working to address bottlenecks caused by surging exports. There is a potential lack of enough dynamic positioning (DP) tankers to ferry crude from offshore production sites to the coast. Petrobras has six DP tankers on order to add to the existing 50. The port of Acu is struggling to keep up with ship-to-ship transfers.
*   **February 2026:** Russian diesel exports have surged, leading to increased imports by Brazil. This is pressuring prices and lessening the price impact of USGC refinery maintenance.
* **January 2026:** Winter Storm Fern created temporary supply disruption affecting 500,000 barrels per day of production as of January 30, 2026, with curtailment extending beyond the immediate storm period.

**Other Relevant Events:**

*   **October 2025:** Ibama approved Amazon drilling shortly before COP30.
*   **January 2026:** Petrobras sealed oil sales agreements with Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL). The deals could represent a potential sale of up to 60 million barrels, with a total value that could exceed $3.1 billion.
*   **February 2026:** The auction for the lease contract for the new container terminal Tecon Santos 10 at the port of Santos may face further delays due to pressure to ease restrictions on companies' participation.
