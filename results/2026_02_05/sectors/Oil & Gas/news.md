Okay, I will compile a chronological list of recent news and events affecting the Oil & Gas sector in Brazil, focusing on M&A activity, legislation, global events impacting the sector, and supply chain disruptions.

Here's a chronological summary of recent news and events impacting Brazil's Oil & Gas sector:

**M&A Activity:**

*   **2025 Trends:** Brazil's M&A market saw significant activity in the energy and natural resources sector, with transactions exceeding US$58 billion, a 26.5% increase compared to 2024. The energy and natural resources sector accounted for over 50% of the total value transacted, exceeding US$30 billion.
*   **Drivers:** The increase in M&A activity is attributed to the resilient nature of the sector, which is less exposed to domestic market fluctuations and political uncertainties. High-interest rates have also impacted company valuations.
*   **Future Outlook (Late 2025):** Mining, energy, and infrastructure segments are expected to continue driving M&A deals in 2026. While large-scale transactions are anticipated, the overall volume of M&A activity is projected to remain stable.
*   **Key Deals:** PRIO was advised on two cross-border acquisitions totaling approximately $5.4 billion, involving the Peregrino and Pitangola oil fields in the Campos Basin.
*   **Shell & KUFPEC:** Shell Brasil Petróleo agreed to sell a 20% interest in the Orca project to Energy Development Corporation (EDC), an affiliate of Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company (KUFPEC). The completion of the transaction is expected by the end of 2026.

**Legislation:**

*   **New Gas Law:** Law No. 14,134/2021 (New Gas Law) intends to foster competition in the sector. Decree No. 12,153/2024 regulates various aspects of this law.
*   **Low-Emission Hydrogen Legal Framework:** The introduction of the Low-Emission Hydrogen Legal Framework establishes regulatory guidelines for the production, storage, and commercialization of low-carbon hydrogen.
*   **Environmental Licensing Bill (May 2025):** Lula's Senate allies passed a sweeping environmental-licensing bill just a week before the UN Climate Meetings in Bonn.
*   **"People's Gas" Program:** Sindigás highlights the approval of the "People's Gas" program, reinforces the implementation of Provisional Measure 1.313/2025, and expands access to cooking gas for vulnerable families throughout Brazil.

**Global Events:**

*   **US Tariffs (September 2025):** Tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Brazilian imports led to a redirection of oil flows from Brazil to Asia, particularly China.
*   **China's Demand:** Strong demand from China has shielded Petrobras from the worst of the tariff war fallout. China accounted for 52% of Petrobras' oil exports in the second quarter of 2025.
*   **China's Crude Imports (2025):** China's crude oil imports hit a record high in 2025, spurred by geopolitical tensions and global oversupply. Brazil's production growth contributed to a 28% increase in its deliveries to China.
*   **US pressure on parallel oil trade:** US pressure on the parallel oil trade exposes China's vulnerability and could create distortions in the global market.
*   **Oversupply:** Global markets are expected to be oversupplied in the coming years, and production is set to expand again in 2026, with the United States and Brazil leading the charge.

**Supply Chain:**

*   **Infrastructure Bottlenecks:** Infrastructure bottlenecks, including limited interconnections and uneven pipeline access, fragment the natural gas market and create regional disparities.
*   **Gas Supply Infrastructure:** Brazil is undertaking projects to secure gas supply infrastructure, including pipeline extensions, LNG terminal connections and storage development.
*   **Venezuela:** The US stopping sanctioned oil tankers traveling in and out of Venezuela has disrupted supplies.

**Other Key Events:**

*   **Record Production (2025):** Brazil achieved record oil and gas production in 2025, driven by pre-salt performance and rising natural gas output. Average daily production climbed to 4.897 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 13% increase compared to 2023.
*   **ANP Forecasts (January 2026):** The National Agency for Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP) forecasts US$1.2 billion in investments for oil and gas exploration in Brazil between 2026 and 2033, focusing on offshore drilling.
*   **Ibama Approval (October 2025):** Brazil's environmental agency Ibama approved Petrobras to drill an exploratory well in Block FZA-M-59, off the mouth of the Amazon.
*   **Petrobras Investments:** According to the regulator ANP, financial contributions to exploration and production (E&P) activities in the country are expected to reach US$31.4 billion next year, with around a quarter of the total earmarked for the construction of production platforms. Petrobras is the main highlight, with projected capex on the order of US$14.8 billion.
*   **FPSO P-78:** Petrobras is commencing operations on the P-78 platform in the Búzios Field. Production started on December 31 with a capacity of 180,000 barrels of oil and 7.2 million cubic meters of gas per day.
*   **Auctions:** Also in 2026, the government plans to hold new auctions for concession and production sharing.
*   **Fossil Fuel Phase-Out:** Brazil groups seek fossil fuel phase-out.
