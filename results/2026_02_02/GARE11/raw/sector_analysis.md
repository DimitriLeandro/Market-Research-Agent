Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic analysis of the Hybrid/Logistics sector in Brazil, focusing on the specified drivers and adhering to the given constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Hybrid/Logistics sector in Brazil, based on the research objectives:

### Commodity/Input Prices

*   **Iron Ore:** On January 30, 2026, Iron Ore fell to $105.62 USD/T, which is a 0.14% decrease from the previous day. However, this price is 3.97% higher than a year ago. Over the past 4 weeks, Iron Ore gained 4.67%, and in the last 12 months, it decreased 4.26%.
*   **Brent Crude Oil:** The value of Brent Crude Oil is 351.65 Brazilian Real. On February 5, 2026, the price of Brent Crude Oil is $65.64 USD. The Brent Crude Oil price today is $66.39 USD.
*   **Pulp Prices:** No specific current data on pulp prices was found in the search results.
*   **CBIOs (Carbon Credits):** The average CBIO price was R$59.30 ($10.70) on May 13, 2025, its lowest since September 2022. By June 12, 2025, the price had slightly recovered to R$59.50. In October 2024, CBIO prices rose by 17% over two weeks to R$91 ($16), the highest level since May.

### Interest Rates & Inflation

*   **Selic Rate:** The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) maintained the Selic rate at 15.00% per year in January 2026. There are expectations that the BCB may signal the start of a rate-cut cycle as early as March.
*   **IPCA (Inflation):** The National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) for December 2025 showed an acceleration of 0.33%, compared to 0.18% in the previous month. The 12-month cumulative rate closed 2025 at 4.26%, within the tolerance bands.
*   **Impact:** High interest rates may make real estate credit more expensive and inhibit new projects.

### Regulatory Actions

*   **ANTT (National Land Transport Agency):** In February 2026, ANTT approved the submission to the audit court (TCU) of the concession process for the highway system formed by highways BR-116 and BR-324 in Bahia. The concession contract has capex estimated at 15.7 billion reais and opex projected at 8 billion reais.
*   **Central Bank of Brazil (BCB):** On December 18, 2025, the BCB issued Resolution No. 542, establishing a consolidated regulatory framework for foreign exchange brokerage firms. On September 5, 2025, the BCB issued measures to strengthen the safety of the National Financial System, including changes to Pix regulations. Non-authorized payment institutions must apply for BCB accreditation to operate within Brazil's Pix system between January 1, 2026, and May 1, 2026.

### Global Correlation

*   **China:** Chinese companies invested $2.2 billion in Brazil in the first six months of 2025, a 5% increase compared to the same period the previous year. This represents about 10% of China's total investment abroad in that period. China's MMG acquired all the Brazilian nickel mines owned by Anglo American.
*   **US Fed Rates:** Expectations of steady U.S. interest rates, combined with the possibility of signaling a prolonged pause in rate cuts, are likely to sustain Treasury yields and favor the dollar globally. Increased U.S. involvement in external disputes has heightened perceptions of political instability in the country, driving a flight from U.S. assets and favoring currencies with higher interest rate differentials, such as the real.
*   **US Tariffs:** The U.S. government levied 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods earlier in August 2025. The tariffs impact approximately US$ 11 billion in Brazilian products, with approximately US$ 3 billion in agriculture.
