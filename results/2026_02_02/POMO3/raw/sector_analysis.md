Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Industrial/Automotive sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Industrial/Automotive sector in Brazil, as of February 2, 2026:

**Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Platinum and Palladium:** As of early 2026, platinum spot prices were near $2,446/oz and palladium around $1,826/oz. Platinum surged over 90% from Q2 through year-end 2025, while palladium gained over 83% in 2025. These increases reflect supply constraints and geopolitical concerns.
*   **Iron Ore:** In late January 2026, weaker iron ore prices pressured exporters. Vale reported 4Q25 iron ore output of 336.1 million tonnes.
*   **Biodiesel:** In the week ending January 23, 2026, the weekly contract indicator for biodiesel in the Parana-Santa Catarina region was close to $1,030/m³, while reaching $1,010/m³ in Rio Grande do Sul state. On January 28, 2026, prices in Araucaria, in Parana state, in the spot market reached $1,007/m³.
*   **General Commodity Prices:** The World Bank projects that global commodity prices will drop by 7% in both 2025 and 2026.

**Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **Interest Rates:** High interest rates and limited credit are affecting consumers' ability to finance new cars.
*   **Inflation:** In August 2025, Brazil's twelve-month inflation rate reached 5.1%, above the 3% target. For Brazilian car rental companies, price adjustments are expected to be closer to the inflation rate in 2026, following significant rental price increases in recent years.

**Regulatory Actions:**

*   **Import Taxes on EVs:** As of July 1, 2025, Brazil increased import taxes on electrified vehicles (EVs). The new rates rose from 25% to 30% for HEVs, from 20% to 28% for PHEVs, and from 18% to 25% for BEVs. The full 35% rate is to be reinstated for all types in July 2026.
*   **Mover Program:** Brazil's Mover Program, approved by Congress, aims to "decarbonize" the automotive industry. The government has approved BRL 19.3 billion (US$ 3.47 billion) in tax credits for companies participating in the program from 2024 to 2028.
*   **Tariff Increases on Chinese Auto Imports:** Tariffs are being reintroduced and are scheduled to reach 35% in 2026.

**Global Correlation:**

*   **Chinese EV Influence:** Chinese EV manufacturers are expanding into Brazil, capturing market share. Imports from China to Brazil have increased significantly.
*   **US Fed Rate:** Stable interest-rate settings from the US Federal Reserve were digested by investors.
*   **PGM Supply:** Mine supply of platinum group metals remains concentrated in Russia and South Africa, creating supply vulnerability and price support.
*   **Global Automotive Market:** The Brazilian automotive industry is undergoing a transformation driven by post-pandemic recovery, electrification trends, and intensified global competition. In 2024, Brazil produced 2.5 million units, maintaining its position as the largest automotive market in South America.
