Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Retail/Big Box sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Retail/Big Box sector in Brazil, as of February 2, 2026:

**Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Coffee:** As of January 31, 2026, March arabica coffee is down -12.60 (-3.65%), and March ICE robusta coffee is down -74 (-1.77%). Coffee prices are sinking due to forecasts of steady rains in Minas Gerais, Brazil's main coffee-growing region. On December 4, 2025, Conab raised its total Brazil 2025 coffee production estimate by 2.4% to 56.54 million bags, from a September estimate of 55.20 million bags.
*   **Soybeans:** In 2022, soybeans were a major export product of Brazil, valued at USD 47.2 billion.
*   **Crude Petroleum:** In 2022, crude petroleum was a major export product of Brazil, valued at USD 43.1 billion.
*   **Iron Ore:** In 2022, iron ore was a major export product of Brazil, valued at USD 30.1 billion.

**Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **Selic Rate:** In January 2026, Brazil's central bank maintained its benchmark interest rate (Selic) at 15.00%. The Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to keep the Selic rate at 15.00% per year.
*   **Impact of Selic:** A Selic rate of 15% makes many construction projects unviable. In October 2025, CBIC reduced its 2025 growth projection for the construction sector from 2.3 percent to 1.3 percent, citing the impacts of the prolonged high interest rate cycle.
*   **Inflation (IPCA):** The 12-month cumulative IPCA rate closed 2025 at 4.26%. In December 2025, the inflation rate was 4.26%, down from 4.46% in November 2025. On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.33% in December 2025.
*   **Inflation Expectations:** Inflation expectations stand at 4.0% for 2026 and 3.8% for 2027. Copom projects inflation at 3.2% by the third quarter of 2027.

**Regulatory Actions:**

*   **VAT Reform:** Brazil is undergoing a tax reform from 2026-2032, introducing a dual VAT system (CBS at the federal level and IBS at the state and municipal levels). From 2026, CBS and IBS are introduced in a pilot phase at very low rates—0.9% for CBS and 0.1% for IBS—without immediately abolishing existing taxes.
*   **Software Fiscalization:** By 2026, a federal rule requires a software fiscalization model to be mandatory in all states, phasing out hardware-based fiscal devices.
*   **ICMS Changes:** From April 1, 2026, São Paulo is abolishing ICMS tax substitution for perfumery, cosmetics, and personal hygiene products, while Alagoas is raising its general ICMS rate from 19% to 20.5%.
*   **Cross-Border E-commerce:** As of August 1, 2024, the de minimis exemption ended, and a tariff of 20% is now considered for consignments up to USD50, plus 17% of the state tax. From USD50.01 to USD3,000, 60% of the national and 17% of the state tax will be levied.

**Global Correlation:**

*   **US Tariffs:** In April 2025, the US imposed a 10% reciprocal tariff on Brazil. In August 2025, the United States imposed tariffs of up to 50% on Brazilian products.
*   **China Investment:** Chinese investment in projects in Brazil reached approximately US$2.2 billion in the first six months of 2025.
*   **US-China Trade Relations:** As of May 12, 2025, the US committed to removing tariffs imposed under Executive Orders 14257 and 14259 by May 14, 2025.
*   **Impact of US Fed and Geopolitical Tensions:** Expectations of steady U.S. interest rates, combined with the possibility of signaling a prolonged pause in rate cuts, are likely to sustain Treasury yields and favor the dollar globally. Increased U.S. involvement in external disputes has heightened perceptions of political instability in the country, driving a flight from U.S. assets and favoring currencies with higher interest rate differentials, such as the real.
*   **Commodity Prices:** The rise of commodity prices since mid-2020 continued to pressure food prices and prices in general in 2021.
*   **World Commodity Prices:** Global commodity prices are projected to fall to their lowest level in six years in 2026. Prices are forecast to drop by 7% in both 2025 and 2026.
