Okay, I will extract the requested financial data for TRXF11, focusing on the most recent quarterly results compared to the same quarter last year, and any management guidance provided. I will present the data in a raw data log format, with precise numbers, percentage changes where available, and context for the changes.

Okay, I have gathered information regarding TRXF11. However, I was unable to find a recent quarterly report with the specific financial data points requested (Net Revenue, EBITDA, Net Income, Operating Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow) for the last reported quarter vs. the same quarter last year. I can provide some general information about the fund and recent activities, but not the hard financial data log as requested.
