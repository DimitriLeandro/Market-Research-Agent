**2. Interest Rates & Inflation:**

FocusEconomics panelists expect average inflation to gradually ease in H1 2026, before picking up slightly again in H2 2026, remaining within the Central Bank's 1.5–4.5% tolerance band.
*   **Impact:** High borrowing costs, coupled with softer wage growth, are expected to keep private consumption growth weak in 2026.

ANP updated the methodology for calculating the WACC for the next regulatory cycle, which will govern returns on regulated investments from 2026 to 2030.

*   **US Fed Rates:** External forces such as US economic conditions and global financial volatility continue to affect emerging markets.
*   **US Tariffs:** A 50% tariff on all Brazilian imports to the United States could disrupt global commodity markets, particularly impacting the pulp industry.
