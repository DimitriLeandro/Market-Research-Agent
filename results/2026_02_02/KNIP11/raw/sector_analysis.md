Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Paper/Receivables sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Paper/Receivables sector in Brazil:

### Commodity/Input Prices

*   **Iron Ore:** On January 30, 2026, Iron Ore was priced at $105.62 USD/T, a 0.14% decrease from the previous day. Over the past month, the price has decreased by 1.41%, but it is 3.97% higher than a year ago. Vale forecasts iron ore prices will stabilize around $100/t in 2026.
*   **Brent Oil:** On February 2, 2026, Brent Crude oil fell to $66.38 USD/Bbl, a 4.24% decrease from the previous day. Over the past month, Brent's price has risen 7.48%, but it is still 12.61% lower than a year ago. The EIA projects Brent crude to average $55.08 per barrel in 2026.
*   **Pulp:** On January 30, 2026, Kraft Pulp was priced at 5302 CNY/T, a 0.93% decrease from the previous day. Over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 3.18%, and is down 13.93% compared to the same time last year. Suzano, a Brazilian pulp maker, will increase pulp prices in February by $10 per metric ton for its clients in Asia, including China, while hiking up prices by $30 per ton in Europe and the Americas.
*   **CBIOs (Decarbonization Credits):** For 2026, the overall target has been set at 48.09 million CBIOs, equivalent to a reduction of 48.09 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. The National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP) will distribute this target among fuel distributors based on their share of the fossil fuel market.

### Interest Rates & Inflation

*   **IPCA (Inflation Index):** The IPCA closed 2024 with a cumulative increase of 4.83%. In April 2024, core services inflation dropped to 4.5% y/y (from 5.1%), the lowest rate since September 2021.
*   **Selic Rate:** The Central Bank of Brazil is expected to issue a revised rule to implement the Basel III reforms by early 2026.

### Regulatory Actions

*   **ANEEL (Electricity):** On January 29, 2026, ANEEL authorized the 2025 Electric Power Transmission Subsidies Plan (POTEE 2025), which includes 687 Small-Scale Reinforcements to be deployed across Brazil's electricity transmission system, representing total investments of approximately BRL 1 billion over the next four years. The decision was formalized through Regulatory Order No. 200/2026.
*   **ANP (Biofuels):** Brazil's National Council for Energy Policy (CNPE) fixed annual mandatory targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions from fuel sales for the period between 2026 and 2035. For 2026, the overall target has been set at 48.09 million CBIOs.
*   **Central Bank of Brazil:** On April 24, 2025, the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) announced its list of regulatory priorities for 2025 and 2026, including the evolution of Open Finance, virtual asset regulations, monitoring artificial intelligence usage, and the expansion of Pix's functionalities. The agenda also includes measures for improving sustainability, increased transparency in rural credit, reviewing prudential standards, and modernizing payment schemes. The BCB will assess the structure and operation of deposit guarantee funds in 2026.
*   **Financial Regulation:** More extensive capital reforms are expected in 2026. The agencies intend to issue a revised rule to implement the Basel III reforms by early 2026 and to tackle other areas including the surcharge applicable to GSIBs.

### Global Correlation

*   **China:** China is expected to adopt stimulus measures for its economy, boosting iron ore demand. China bought about 4.97 million tonnes of wood pulp exported by Brazil in the first eight months of this year, becoming the biggest buyer of such exports in that period.
*   **US Fed Rates:** There is no specific information found in the search results about the direct impact of US Fed rates on the Brazilian paper/receivables sector.
*   **General Global Influences:** Newly announced trade tariffs and global tensions have increased uncertainty across the market, causing late-March volatility in demand and pricing.
