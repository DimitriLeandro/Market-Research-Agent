Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic analysis of the Retail/Urban Income sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Retail/Urban Income sector in Brazil:

**1. Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Iron Ore:** On January 30, 2026, Iron Ore was at $105.62 USD/T, a 0.14% decrease from the previous day. It is 3.97% higher than a year ago. The 52-week price range for Iron Ore 62% futures spans from 93.41 to 108.48.
*   **Brent Crude Oil:** The value of Brent Crude Oil is 351.65 Brazilian Real. The price of Brent Crude Oil is $66.39.
*   **CBIOs (Carbon Credits):** The average CBIO price was R$59.30 ($10.70) on May 13, 2025, the lowest since September 2022. By June 12, 2025, the price had recovered slightly to R$59.50. In October 2024, CBIO prices rose by 17% over two weeks to R$91 ($16), the highest level since May.

**2. Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **Selic Rate:** The Central Bank of Brazil (COPOM) is expected to maintain the Selic rate at 15.00% per year. Investors are closely watching for signals about potential rate cuts as early as March.
*   **Impact of Selic:** High interest rates are seen as a major impediment to short-term credit and long-term financing. High Selic rate makes mortgage credit more expensive and discourages new construction projects.
*   **IPCA (Inflation):** The 12-month cumulative IPCA rate closed 2025 at 4.26%. In December 2024, the IPCA hit 0.52%, with a cumulative increase of 4.83% for the year.
*   **Impact of IPCA:** The Central Bank aims to keep the twelve-month IPCA inflation centered on the target set by the National Monetary Council (CMN).

**3. Regulatory Actions:**

*   **ANEEL:** No specific recent regulatory changes by ANEEL were found in the provided context.
*   **ANP:** On December 29, 2025, ANP approved a revised natural gas tariff regime, clarifying capacity contracting rules and establishing a stable pricing mechanism for entry-exit transport operators. ANP updated the methodology for calculating the WACC for the 2026-2030 regulatory cycle. On June 26, 2025, ANP's board decided that fuel sales would be barred to distributors failing to meet RenovaBio targets.
*   **ANS:** In May 2022, ANS published Normative Resolution No. 529/2022, regulating anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing duties for healthcare operators.
*   **Central Bank:** The Central Bank is expected to keep the Selic rate at 15.00% per year. The Central Bank of Brazil established new rules regarding the minimum capital required for financial institutions to operate in Brazil, starting in 2028, increasing to USD 1.68 billion. The Central Bank has introduced tougher regulations for crypto exchanges and brokers.
*   **New Legislation:** On November 26, 2025, Brazil enacted a tax reform expanding the federal income tax exemption for workers earning up to 5,000 reais a month and creating a minimum tax for high-income taxpayers. On December 17, 2025, Congress approved Complementary Bill No. 128/2025, mandating reductions in federal tax incentives and increasing the withholding tax rate on Interest on Net Equity (INE) to 17.5%, effective from January 1, 2026.

**4. Global Correlation:**

*   **China Stimulus:** No specific data was found regarding the direct impact of China's stimulus on the Brazilian Retail/Urban Income sector.
*   **US Fed Rates:** Expectations of steady U.S. interest rates are likely to sustain Treasury yields and favor the dollar globally. When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, US assets become more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real.
*   **Geopolitical Tensions:** Geopolitical tensions involving the U.S. can influence the search for "safe-haven" assets, impacting the Brazilian Real.
