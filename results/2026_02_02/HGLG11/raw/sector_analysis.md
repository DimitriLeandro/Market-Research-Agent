Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Logistics sector in Brazil, focusing on the external environment and adhering to the specified constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Logistics sector in Brazil:

*   **Commodity/Input Prices:**
    *   **Iron Ore:** On January 30, 2026, Iron Ore was at USD 105.62/T, a 0.14% decrease from the previous day. Over the past month, the price has fallen 1.41%, but it is 3.97% higher than a year ago.
    *   **Pulp:** On January 30, 2026, Kraft Pulp was at 5302 CNY/T, a 0.93% decrease from the previous day. Over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 3.18%, and is down 13.93% compared to the same time last year. However, Suzano announced that they will increase pulp prices in February by $10 per metric ton for its clients in Asia, including China, while hiking up prices by $30 per ton in Europe and the Americas.
    *   **CBIOs (Carbon Credits):** In June 2025, the average CBIO price was R$59.30 ($10.70) on May 13, its lowest since September 2022. By June 12, 2025, the price had slightly recovered to R$59.50.
*   **Interest Rates & Inflation:**
    *   **Selic Rate:** As of January 2026, Brazil's central bank maintained its benchmark interest rate at 15.00% per year. The Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to maintain this rate in the near term.
    *   **IPCA:** The National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) for December 2025 showed an acceleration of 0.33%, compared to 0.18% in the previous month. The 12-month cumulative rate closed 2025 at 4.26%. Brazil IPCA: Transport data was reported at 6,992.530 Dec1993=100 in Dec 2025. This records an increase from the previous number of 6,941.170 Dec1993=100 for Nov 2025.
*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   **Tax Reform:** Complementary Bill 68/2024, which institutes the Tax on Goods and Services (IBS), the Social Contribution on Goods and Services (CBS) and the Selective Tax (IS), has been approved by the Chamber of Deputies and is heading for consideration by the Federal Senate and presidential sanction. The approved basic text included an estimated 26.5% cap on the rate of the future Value Added Tax (VAT).
    *   **Senate Approved Tax Hike Package:** On December 17, 2025, Brazil's Senate approved draft legislation to reduce tax breaks for several sectors and raise the tax burden on online sports betting wagers, fintech firms, and interest on equity.
*   **Global Correlation:**
    *   **China:** Chinese investment in projects in Brazil reached approximately US$2.2 billion in the first six months of 2025, a 5% increase compared to the same period the previous year.
    *   **US Fed Rates:** When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, US assets become more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real. This depreciation increases the cost of importing inputs and raises financing costs for Brazilian companies, reducing their investment capacity.
    *   **US Tariffs:** In August 2025, Brazil's government rolled out a relief package including 30 billion reais ($5.6 billion) in credit to support local companies affected by US tariffs.
*   **Logistics Market Size:**
    *   The Brazil logistics market generated a revenue of USD 250.6 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 371.4 billion by 2030. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.8% from 2025 to 2030.
    *   Brazil freight and logistics market size in 2026 is estimated at USD 116.42 billion, growing from 2025 value of USD 111.11 billion with 2031 projections showing USD 147.06 billion, growing at 4.78% CAGR over 2026-2031.
