Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Brazilian Oil & Gas sector, focusing on the external environment and adhering to the specified constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Brazilian Oil & Gas sector:

*   **Commodity/Input Prices:**
    *   **Brent Oil:** Oil and fuel prices increased considerably in the first half of 2022, influenced by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and stronger global demand growth.
    *   **CBIOs (Carbon Credits):** In October 2024, CBIO prices rose by 17% over two weeks, reaching R$91 ($16), the highest level since May 2024, driven by demand ahead of the year-end Renovabio compliance deadline. However, average CBIO trading prices were at their lowest levels since 2022, mainly reflecting insecurity caused by sector defaults and oversupply from suppressed demand. The average Cbio price was R59.30 ($10.70) on 13 May 2025, its lowest since September 2022, when it hit R61.20.
    *   **Natural Gas:** The price of natural gas for the industrial sector in Brazil reached approximately BRL 52.6 per GJ in May 2025, reflecting a 0.4% decrease from the previous month but a 9.5% increase year-over-year.

*   **Interest Rates & Inflation:**
    *   **Selic Rate:** As of January 2026, the Selic rate remained at 15%. The central bank is expected to begin cutting rates again in March.
    *   **Impact of Selic:** A 1% increase in consumer interest rates increases default rates by 0.746% over a 3- to 4-month period. Lower interest rates in the United States could attract investment to Brazil and create room for cuts in the Selic rate.
    *   **Inflation (IPCA):** Headline inflation decelerated to an annual 4.26% in December. In October 2025, inflation rose to 4.7% on a year-ago basis, down from 5.2% in September, the slowest rate of price growth since January 2025. Energy prices were the main reason for the easing of inflation.
    *   **Impact of Oil Prices on Inflation:** Oil prices have a positive influence on Brazil's overall price index and persist for a considerable number of periods.

*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   **New Gas Law (2021):** Law No. 14.134/2021 establishes a new legal framework to restructure the natural gas sector, aiming to improve economic competitiveness, encourage new agents, promote market decentralization, and foster new investment.
    *   **Decree No. 12.153/2024:** Decree No. 12.153/2024, which amends Decree No. 10.712/21 and regulates Law 14.134/2021, addresses the offloading, handling, processing, underground storage, conditioning, liquifying, regasification, and commercialization of natural gas.
    *   **Provisional Measure (MP) 1.304:** In October 2025, the Brazilian Congress approved Provisional Measure (MP) 1.304, which establishes new rules for the electricity sector and promotes changes in the oil and gas sector.
    *   **"Fuel of the Future" Law (Law No. 14,993/2024):** Law No. 14,993/2024 institutes national programs to incentivize the use of biofuels like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), green diesel, and biomethane, and also provides the legal framework for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS).
    *   **Biodiesel Import Ban:** Since December 2023, only domestically produced biodiesel has been allowed for meeting Brazil's biofuel blending mandate.
    *   **ANP Decree No. 12,153/24:** Decree enhances the ANP’s role in the natural gas market, specifically in gas pricing, by implementing tariff regulation mechanisms for gas flow pipelines and other infrastructures, which were previously subject to free negotiation between the parties.
    *   **Fossil Fuel Phase-Out Plan:** A group of organizations proposed a plan to end crude block auctions, add biomethane, biodiesel, ethanol and hydrogen to Brazil's transport sector, and eliminate fossil fuel subsidies.

*   **Global Correlation:**
    *   **China's Influence:** In 2024, Chinese investments in Brazil more than doubled year-over-year, reaching $4.18 billion across 39 projects, with the energy sector capturing the largest share. China has maintained its position as Brazil's largest trading partner for 15 consecutive years, with energy investments deepening this economic relationship.
    *   **US Fed Rates:** Lower interest rates in the United States could attract investment to Brazil and create room for cuts in the Selic rate. The Federal Reserve held its benchmark interest rate steady at 3.5%-3.75% at its first Federal Open Market Committee meeting of the year.
    *   **US Dollar Weakness:** The Brazilian real ended Tuesday's trading session at R5.20/$1 on January 27, 2026, the strongest closing level since May 2024, partly thanks to the central bank's firm maintenance of the target rate at 15pc since June last year. The real's strength also reflects a global weakening of the US dollar.
    *   **China's oil demand:** China, the world's biggest oil importer, has already reached a plateau in demand for oil-based fuels.
