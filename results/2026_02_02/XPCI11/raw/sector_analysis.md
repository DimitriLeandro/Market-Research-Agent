Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Paper/Receivables sector in Brazil, focusing on the external environment and adhering to the specified constraints.

*   **Iron Ore Price:** Vale forecasts iron ore prices to stabilize at approximately $100/ton in 2026. However, on January 30, 2026, iron ore was at $105.62 USD/T, a 0.14% decrease from the previous day, but a 3.97% increase YoY.
*   **Brent Crude Oil Price:** Brent Crude oil was at $66.38 USD/Bbl on February 2, 2026, a 4.24% decrease from the previous day, and a 12.61% decrease YoY. The EIA forecasts an average of $56 per barrel in 2026.
*   **Pulp Prices:** Suzano announced pulp price increases of $30 per ton in Europe and the Americas in February 2026. Kraft Pulp was at 5302 CNY/T on January 30, 2026, a 0.93% decrease from the previous day, and a 13.93% decrease YoY.

*   **ANEEL Regulatory Actions:** ANEEL cancelled 509 permits for solar PV and wind power projects in 2025, representing approximately 22 GW of planned capacity. ANEEL is also proposing changes to the White Hourly Tariff, potentially migrating low-voltage consumers consuming more than 1,000 kWh/month to this model by the end of 2026.

More extensive capital reforms are expected in early 2026 to implement Basel III reforms.
*   **China Stimulus:** China is expected to adopt stimulus measures for its economy, potentially boosting iron ore demand. China bought 4.97 million tonnes of wood pulp exported by Brazil in the first eight months of this year, becoming the biggest buyer of such exports in that period.
*   **US Fed Rates:** Unclear, the search results did not yield information about the direct impact of US Fed rates on the Brazilian paper/receivables sector.
