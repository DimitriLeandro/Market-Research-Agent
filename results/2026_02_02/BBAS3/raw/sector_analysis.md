Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Financials sector in Brazil, focusing on the external environment and adhering to the specified constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers impacting the Financials sector in Brazil:

### Commodity/Input Prices

*   **CBIO Prices:** In June 2025, the average CBIO price was R$59.50 ($10.70), a slight recovery from R$59.30 ($10.70) on May 13, which was the lowest since September 2022. In October 2024, CBIO prices rose by 17% over two weeks to R$91 ($16), the highest level since May 2024. In March 2025, Platts proposed incorporating the price of Brazilian CBIO carbon credits into its assessments of Brazilian ethanol.
*   **Iron Ore & Oil:** As Brazil's economy relies on commodity exports, the prices of iron ore and oil significantly influence the financial market.

### Interest Rates & Inflation

*   **Selic Rate:** As of January 2026, the Central Bank of Brazil maintained the Selic rate at 15.00%. The Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to keep the Selic rate at 15.00% per year.
*   **Inflation Expectations:** Inflation expectations for 2025 and 2026 remain elevated at 4.5% and 4.2%, respectively. Copom projects inflation at 3.2% by the third quarter of 2027.
*   **IPCA:** Brazil ended 2025 with an IPCA of 4.26%. In December 2024, the IPCA was 0.52%, bringing the cumulative increase for 2024 to 4.83%.
*   **Impact of Interest Rates:** High interest rates and bank lending costs constrain consumer and business credit, especially in interest-sensitive sectors like retail, autos, and housing.

### Regulatory Actions

*   **Taxation of Interest on Net Equity (INE):** On June 11, 2025, the Brazilian Government published Provisional Measure No. 1,303/2025, increasing the taxation of INE payments from 15% to 20%, effective January 1, 2026.
*   **Withholding Tax on Financial Investments:** A 5% withholding tax on income from certain financial investments related to real estate and agribusiness is effective from January 1, 2026.
*   **Tax Rate on Online Betting Operations:** The tax rate on online betting operations increased from 12% to 18% starting October 1, 2025.
*   **Fintech and Betting Sectors Tax Increases:** The Senate advanced tax increases for fintechs, payment service providers, and exchanges, with rates gradually increasing to 12% in 2026 and 15% in 2028. Institutions engaged in capitalisation, credit, financing and investment activities would see their rate climbing from 15% to 17.5% in 2026 and then to 20% in 2028.
*   **Central Bank Resolution No. 518:** On November 11, 2025, the BCB issued Resolution No 518, amending the rules on opening, maintaining, and closing payment accounts, effective December 1, 2025.
*   **New Consumption Tax Reform:** On January 14, 2026, Complementary Law No. 227/2026 was published, marking the second stage of implementation of the Consumption Tax Reform.
*   **Tax on Dividends:** In March 2025, Bill No. 1,087/2025 was introduced, proposing a 10% tax on dividends paid to foreign shareholders.

### Global Correlation

*   **US Fed Rate Hikes:** When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, US assets become more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real.
*   **US Tariffs:** US tariffs may reduce the supply of certain commodities, raising their prices in the international market, which could benefit Brazilian exporters of agricultural products and minerals.
*   **Geopolitical Tensions:** Geopolitical tensions involving the U.S. can influence the search for “safe-haven” assets, impacting the Brazilian real.
*   **China Stimulus:** China's economic activity and stimulus measures can influence commodity prices and demand, affecting the Brazilian financial sector.
*   **US Economic Conditions:** External factors such as US economic conditions and global financial volatility continue to affect emerging markets.
*   **US Government Shutdown:** The possibility of a shutdown of public services in the US could intensify aversion to the dollar and stimulate portfolio diversification toward emerging markets, benefiting the real.
