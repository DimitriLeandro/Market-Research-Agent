Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Financials sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers impacting the Financials sector in Brazil:

*   **Interest Rates & Inflation:**
    *   The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) maintained the Selic rate at 15.00% in January 2026, signaling a need for a prolonged hold to keep inflation on track amid uncertainty.
    *   Inflation expectations for 2025 and 2026 remain elevated at 4.5% and 4.2%, respectively. Copom projects 3.2% for the second quarter of 2027.
    *   The BCB acknowledged the impact of high interest rates on corporate balance sheets and credit availability.
    *   In August 2025, Brazil's twelve-month inflation rate was 5.1%, above the 3% target.
    *   A 1 percentage point increase in the Selic rate raises lending rates by approximately 0.7 percentage point after four months.

*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   In early November 2025, the Central Bank of Brazil published Joint Resolution No. 14/2025 and Resolution No. 517/2025, amending the criteria for calculating minimum paid-in capital and net worth for financial institutions.
    *   The Central Bank of Brazil has established new rules regarding the minimum capital required for financial institutions to operate in Brazil. Starting from 2028, the minimum will rise to USD 1.68 billion.
    *   A transition period for compliance with new minimum capital requirements begins in June 2026 and ends in December 2027.
    *   On May 22, 2025, the Brazilian Federal Government published Decree 12.466/2025, significantly increasing tax rates on credit transactions (IOF-credit) and certain foreign exchange transactions (IOF-FX), effective from May 23, 2025.
    *   Brazil's FX framework was significantly modernized by Law No 14,286, regulated by BCB Resolution No 277 and No 278, of December 31, 2022.
    *   In 2024, the Central Bank conducted a public hearing to gather input on Banking as a Service (“BaaS”) regulations it plans to issue in 2025.

*   **Global Correlation:**
    *   External factors, including US economic conditions and global financial volatility, continue to affect emerging markets like Brazil.
    *   A stronger euro is usually associated with a globally weaker dollar, which could indirectly benefit the real.
    *   Brazil is likely to benefit from demand for its exports (oil, soybeans, iron ore, and meat) from both the U.S. and China.

*   **Additional Factors:**
    *   Brazil's banking sector was valued at $200-250 billion in 2024.
    *   90% of adults were banked by 2025, up from 68% less than a decade earlier.
    *   The services sector is the main driver of the Brazilian economy, accounting directly and indirectly for about 70% of the GDP.
    *   The economy's growth moderated to an annualized 1.5% in the second quarter of 2025.
    *   The fiscal deficit averaged 7.7% of GDP in the decade to 2024.
    *   The unemployment rate averaged 10.5% in the decade to 2024.
    *   Inflation averaged 5.9% in the decade to 2024.
    *   Total assets of the Brazilian financial system are around 160% of GDP.
