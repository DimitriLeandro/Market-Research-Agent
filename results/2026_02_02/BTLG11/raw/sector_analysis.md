Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Logistics sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Logistics sector in Brazil, as of February 2, 2026:

*   **Commodity/Input Prices:**
    *   **Iron Ore:** The price of Iron Ore is $105.85 USD/T, the lowest since November 2025. Over the past year, it has increased by 4.67%. In December 2025, Brazil exported $2.93B of Iron Ore.
    *   **Brent Oil:** Brent Crude Oil is at $66.38 USD/Bbl, a decrease of 4.24% from the previous day. Over the past month, Brent's price has risen 7.48%, but it is still 12.61% lower than a year ago.
    *   **Pulp:** In 2024, the average wood pulp export price from Brazil was $537 per ton, a 29% increase compared to 2023. Kraft Pulp was at 5302 CNY/T on January 30, 2026, down 0.93% from the previous day and down 13.93% compared to the same time last year.
    *   **CBIOs (Carbon Credits):** Average CBIO trading prices were at their lowest levels since 2022. The average CBIO price was R$59.30 ($10.70) on May 13, 2025. It reached R$59.50 on June 12, 2025.

*   **Interest Rates & Inflation:**
    *   **Selic Rate:** The Central Bank of Brazil maintained the Selic rate at 15.00% in January 2026. The Central Bank is expected to keep the Selic rate at 15.00% per year.
    *   **IPCA (Inflation):** The 12-month cumulative IPCA rate closed 2025 at 4.26%.

*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   **Reverse Logistics:** In January 2026, Ordinances GM/MMA No. 1,560 and No. 1,561 updated reverse logistics systems for electronic products and packaging, maintaining targets and expanding the scope of materials. New materials in the scope of reverse logistics for packaging include paper, cardboard, metals, and glass.
    *   **Biodiesel Imports:** Fuel importers are arguing to end the ban on biodiesel imports to increase competition. Since December 2023, only domestically produced biodiesel has been allowed for meeting Brazil's biofuel blending mandate.
    *   **Environmental Licensing:** Infra S.A. launched a public consultation to update rules associated with environmental licensing for major works.
    *   **ANP (National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels):** Brazil's environmental licensing system operates through three-tiered approvals administered by state and federal agencies and fuel specifications are regulated separately by the ANP.

*   **Global Correlation:**
    *   **China:** In December 2025, Brazil exported Iron Ore mostly to China ($1.95B).
    *   **US Fed Rates:** When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, it strengthens the dollar against other currencies, including the real, decreasing Brazil's purchasing power on the international market.
    *   **US Tariffs:** Brazilian ports' cargo handling rose by 7.8% in August 2025, even with increased US tariffs. Exports to the US dropped by 17% due to tariffs on key products.
    *   **Geopolitical Tensions:** Increased US involvement in external disputes has heightened perceptions of political instability in the country, driving a flight from US assets and favoring currencies with higher interest rate differentials, such as the real.
