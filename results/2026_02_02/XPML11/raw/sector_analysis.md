Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Shopping Malls sector in Brazil, focusing on the external environment and adhering to the specified constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Shopping Malls sector in Brazil:

*   **Iron Ore Spot Price:** On January 30, 2026, Iron Ore 62% Fe CFR China (TSI) Swap Futures was priced at $105.62 USD. Over the past year, the price has increased by 4.23%. Another source indicates Iron Ore increased to $100.77 USD/T, the highest since April 2025. In the last 12 months, it decreased 4.26%.

*   **Brent Oil Price:** On February 2, 2026, Brent Crude Oil was priced at $65.84 USD. There was a 5.02% decrease.

*   **Pulp Prices:** On January 30, 2026, Kraft Pulp was priced at 5302 CNY/T. This represents a 3.18% decrease over the past month and a 13.93% decrease compared to the same time last year.

*   **Selic Rate:** The Selic rate ended 2024 at 12.25%, compared to 11.75% at the end of 2023. The Central Bank of Brazil opted to maintain its benchmark interest rate at 15% in December 2025. High interest rates can negatively impact retailers by increasing debt obligations and reducing capital.

*   **IPCA Inflation:** Brazil's annual inflation rate eased to 4.26% in December 2025, the lowest reading since August 2024. A revenue growth of 1.6% is expected in 2025, which is below the Central Bank's projected inflation of 3.5%.

*   **Regulatory Actions - US Tariffs:** In July 2025, the Trump administration announced new reciprocal tariff rates, including 50% for Brazil. This could take the total effective tariff rate close to 17%. The 50% tariff on Brazilian imports to the United States could significantly impact the pulp market.

*   **Global Correlation - China:** Chinese companies invested $2.2 billion in Brazil in the first six months of 2025, a 5% increase compared to the same period a year earlier. Brazil is a major market for Chinese EVs, e-commerce and technology.

*   **Consumer Behavior:** Data released by the Brazilian Association of Shopping Centers (Abrasce) reveals that the shopping centre public in Brazil is 20% lower than that recorded in the pre-pandemic period.
