Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Brazilian agriculture sector, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

### Macroeconomic and Structural Drivers in Brazilian Agriculture

*   **Commodity/Input Prices:**
    *   In 2025, soybean prices traded between 110 and 145 reais per sack, a decrease from around 200 reais per sack in 2022.
    *   In 2023, prices of agricultural commodities such as soybeans fell by 21.92%, and corn fell even more, by 30.02%.
    *   In the September-October period, the average price of cropland reached R$ 41,144.07 per hectare, a 44.5% increase over the last 12 months. Pasture farmland gained 17.64% in value over the same period, reaching an average price of R$10,672.
*   **Interest Rates & Inflation:**
    *   In August 2025, Brazil's Selic rate was 15%, which increased borrowing costs for farm operations.
    *   In 2023, the Selic rate began the year at 13.75% and closed at 11.75%, after four consecutive cuts in the second half of the year.
    *   Economist André Braz estimates that Brazil's official inflation should close out 2024 at around 4%.
    *   In February 2025, Brazil's headline inflation reached 5.1% y/y.
*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   In June 2025, the National Congress concluded the processing of the new regulatory framework for agricultural pesticides, with the final approval of Law No. 14.785/2023. This law modernizes procedures for the registration, inspection, and use of agricultural pesticides in Brazil.
    *   In June 2025, the Brazilian Senate approved Bill No. 2,159/2021, proposing a unified national framework for environmental licensing to harmonize procedures and deadlines across Brazilian states.
    *   Brazil's Bioinputs Law (Law No. 15,070/2024) allows for the on-farm production of biofertilizers and biopesticides, requiring adherence to good practices and a producer registry.
    *   On January 31, 2026, Brazil's Ministry of Agriculture (MAPA) is finalizing a broader reform expected to reshape how crop protection products are reviewed, registered, and restricted.
*   **Global Correlation:**
    *   In 2021, China accounted for 39% of Brazil's total agricultural exports and 70% of the total volume of Brazil's soybean exports.
    *   In August 2025, the United States imposed 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods. Farm exports to the U.S. reached $12.1 billion in 2024, and industry groups estimate potential annual losses at $5.8 billion under the new tariff regime.
    *   External pressures, due to Russia's war conflicts with Ukraine and the Middle East, influence oil prices, insurance, and the free flow of international trade.
    *   El Niño, the climatic phenomenon that changes the temperature of the waters of the Pacific Ocean, impacts crops in various regions of the planet.
    *   In 2024, Brazilian agribusiness exports totaled USD 164.4 billion.
