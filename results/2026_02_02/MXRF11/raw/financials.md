Okay, I will extract the requested financial data for MXRF11, focusing on the most recent quarterly results compared to the same quarter last year, and present it in the specified raw data log format. I will then search for any management guidance for the full year.

Based on the search results, it's difficult to extract the specific financial data requested (Net Revenue, EBITDA, Net Income, Cash Flow) for the most recent quarter and the corresponding quarter from the previous year. The search results provide general information about MXRF11, including its dividend yield, management fees, and asset allocation.

*   **Dividend Yield (Current):** 1.04% based on a share price of R$9.63.

*   **Asset Allocation:** Approximately 80% in CRIs (Certificados de Recebíveis Imobiliários), 11% in other FIIs, and almost 7% in financial swaps.
