**2. Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **Selic Rate & IPCA Impact:** (Specific impacts of Selic and IPCA on the Hybrid/Paper sector were not directly found. However, the following general impacts were noted).
*   The Central Bank of Brazil is reviewing bank fee regulations to improve and update the rules governing customer charges.
*   The depreciation of the Brazilian Real increases the cost of importing inputs and raises financing costs for Brazilian companies.
*   The Central Bank of Brazil is exploring alternatives to improve the loan granting process and funding sources.

**3. Regulatory Actions:**

*   **ANEEL:** In January 2026, ANEEL authorized the 2025 Electric Power Transmission Subsidies Plan (POTEE 2025), representing approximately BRL 1 billion in investments in new transmission facilities. ANEEL postponed a decision on energy tariff reductions for consumers of 21 distributors in 2026.
*   **Central Bank of Brazil:** In April 2025, the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) announced its regulatory priorities for 2025 and 2026, including the evolution of Open Finance, virtual asset regulations, monitoring artificial intelligence usage, and the expansion of Pix's functionalities.

**4. Global Correlation:**

*   **China Stimulus:** China is expected to adopt stimulus measures for its economy, potentially boosting iron ore demand. Brazilian pulp producers may redirect volumes to Chinese and other Asian markets.
*   **US Fed Rates:** When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, US assets become more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real.
*   **Trade Tensions:** Trade tensions and broader political risks and uncertainty persist and remain of concern to financial markets and their supervisory authorities generally.
*   **US Tariffs:** The increase in trade barriers may affect Brazil’s attractiveness to global investors and the dynamics of Brazilian assets listed on stock exchanges.
