Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Retail sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

*   **Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Interest Rates & Inflation:**
    *   **Selic Rate:** The Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to keep the Selic rate at 15.00% per year as of January 26, 2026.
    *   **Inflation (IPCA):** The National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) for December showed an acceleration of 0.33%, compared to 0.18% in the previous month, according to data from January 26, 2026. The 12-month cumulative rate closed 2025 at 4.26%, marking the second consecutive month within the tolerance bands.
    *   **Inflation Expectations:** Inflation expectations stand at 4.4% for 2025 and 4.2% for 2026, and Copom projects 3.2% by the second quarter of 2027.
*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   **Tax Reform:** Brazil's Tax Reform 2026–2032 introduces a phased replacement of multiple indirect taxes with a dual VAT system (CBS at the federal level and IBS at the state and municipal levels), aiming to simplify taxation and eliminate cascading effects.
    *   **E-commerce Tax:** As of August 1, 2024, a tariff of 20% is considered for consignments up to USD50, plus 17% of the state tax (ICMS). From USD50.01 to USD3,000, 60% of the national and 17% of the state tax will be levied.
    *   **Software Fiscalization:** By 2026, a federal rule requires a software-based fiscal model to be mandatory in all states, and hardware-based fiscal devices will no longer be permitted.
    *   **ICMS Changes:** From April 1, 2026, São Paulo will abolish ICMS tax substitution for perfumery, cosmetics, and personal hygiene products and shift them to the normal VAT regime, while Alagoas will raise its general ICMS rate from 19% to 20.5% and restructure tax benefits.
*   **Global Correlation:**
    *   **Global Value Chains (GVCs):** Brazilian retail is closely linked to GVCs, both in imports and exports. Brazil exports agricultural products, textiles, and electronics.
    *   **Commodity Prices:** Brazil, Chile, and Peru benefited from rising commodity prices in 2025.
    *   **US Fed Rates:** On January 28, 2026, investors digested stable interest-rate settings from the US Federal Reserve.
    *   **Cross-Border E-commerce:** A new enforcement in Brazil will apply a 60% tax to all imported goods valued under $50.
