Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Paper/Hedge sector in Brazil, focusing on the external environment and adhering to the specified constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Paper/Hedge sector in Brazil, based on the search results:

### Commodity/Input Prices

*   **Iron Ore:** On January 30, 2026, Iron Ore was priced at $105.62 USD/T. Over the past month, the price has fallen 1.41%, but it is 3.97% higher than a year ago. Vale forecasts iron ore prices to stabilize around $100/t in 2026.
*   **Brent Oil:** On February 2, 2026, Brent Crude oil fell to $66.38 USD/Bbl. Over the past month, Brent's price has risen 7.48%, but it is still 12.61% lower than a year ago. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects Brent crude to average $55.08 per barrel in 2026.
*   **Pulp:** On January 30, 2026, Kraft Pulp was priced at 5302 CNY/T. Over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 3.18%, and is down 13.93% compared to the same time last year. In February 2026, Suzano will increase pulp prices by $10 per metric ton for clients in Asia, including China, and by $30 per ton in Europe and the Americas.
*   **CBIOs (Decarbonization Credits):** For 2026, the overall target has been set at 48.09 million CBIOs, equivalent to a reduction of 48.09 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.

### Interest Rates & Inflation

*   **Selic Rate:** As of January 26, 2026, the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to keep the Selic rate at 15.00% per year. High interest rates are seen as a major impediment to short-term credit and long-term financing by industrial companies.
*   **IPCA (Inflation):** The 12-month cumulative IPCA rate closed 2025 at 4.26%. Inflation expectations for 2025 and 2026 remain above the inflation target, standing at 5.1% and 4.4%, respectively.

### Regulatory Actions

*   **ANEEL (National Electric Energy Agency):** In 2025, ANEEL cancelled 509 permits for solar PV and wind power projects. ANEEL is also proposing changes to the White Hourly Tariff, potentially making it mandatory for consumers using more than 1,000 kWh/month by the end of 2026.
*   **ANP (National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels):** ANP will distribute the CBIO target among fuel distributors based on their share of the fossil fuel market.
*   **Central Bank:** Copom is expected to maintain the Selic rate at 15.00% per year.
*   **New Legislation:** Law No. 14,993/2024, known as the “Fuel of the Future Law”, incentivizes the use of biofuels. Law No. 15,097/2025 implements new regulations for offshore wind generation.

### Global Correlation

*   **China:** China is expected to adopt stimulus measures for its economy, potentially boosting iron ore demand.
*   **US Fed Rates:** Expectations of steady U.S. interest rates are likely to sustain Treasury yields and favor the dollar globally. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy impacts the purchasing power of the Real. A potential 50% tariff imposed by the U.S. on imports from Brazil could significantly impact the pulp and paper market.
