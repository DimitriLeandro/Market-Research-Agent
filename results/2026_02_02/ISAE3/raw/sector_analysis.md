Okay, I will provide a bulleted list of facts regarding the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Utilities/Energy sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural factors impacting the Utilities/Energy sector in Brazil:

*   **Commodity/Input Prices:**
    *   **Iron Ore:** On January 30, 2026, Iron Ore was priced at $105.62 USD/T. Over the past year, the price of Iron Ore 62% futures has increased by 0.57%.
    *   **Brent Crude Oil:** On February 2, 2026, Brent Crude Oil fell to $66.38 USD/Bbl. This represents a 7.48% increase over the past month, but a 12.61% decrease compared to a year ago. The current price of Brent Oil futures is $66.05, with a previous close of $69.32. Over the past year, the price of Brent Oil futures has changed by -13.19%.
    *   **CBIOs (Brazilian Carbon Credits):** The average CBIO price was R$59.30 ($10.70) on May 13, 2025, the lowest since September 2022. By October 2024, CBIO prices had risen to R$91 ($16), the highest since May, representing a 17% increase over two weeks.
    *   **Electricity:** In May 2025, the price for Electricity for households in Brazil was approximately 0.921 BRL per kWh, a 3.4% rise year-on-year. The price for Electricity for the industrial sector in Brazil stood at around 0.926 BRL per kWh in May 2025, a 9.1% increase year-on-year.
    *   **Gasoline:** Petrobras reduced gasoline prices by 5.2% to BRL 2.57/litre as of February 2, 2026.

*   **Interest Rates & Inflation:**
    *   **Selic Rate:** Brazil's central bank maintained its benchmark interest rate at 15.00% in January 2026.
    *   **IPCA (Inflation):** In June 2025, Brazil's official inflation rate was 0.24%, with residential electricity rising 2.96%. The IPCA accumulated an increase of 2.99% in 2025 and 5.35% in the last 12 months, exceeding the inflation target ceiling. Electricity prices have been a major driver of inflation, with a 6.93% increase in the first half of 2025.

*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   **ANEEL (National Electric Energy Agency):** ANEEL authorized the 2025 Electric Power Transmission Subsidies Plan (POTEE 2025), involving approximately BRL 1 billion in investments across 687 grid projects.
    *   **Opening of Free Energy Market:** The free contracting market for low voltage consumers will open on August 1, 2026, for industrial and commercial consumers, and on December 1, 2027, for residential consumers.
    *   **Supplier of Last Resort (SUI):** The Granting Authority must regulate the role of the SUI by February 1, 2026, defining eligible consumers and whether distributors must carry out this activity.
    *   **Tariff and Accounting Separation:** By July 1, 2026, there must be a tariff and accounting or contractual separation of regulated energy commercialization and public electricity distribution service activities.
    *   **Biodiesel Import Ban:** As of January 29, 2026, a ban on biodiesel imports is in place since December 2023, with some fuel importers arguing that ending the ban could spur competition.
    *   **Renewable Energy Discounts:** A reform proposal includes ending discounts for renewable energy consumption, including self-production, after current contracts expire.
    *   **New National Policy for Access to the Transmission System (PNAST):** Aims to modernize the access model for generators and large consumers to the basic power grid, inaugurating a new planning logic in 2026.

*   **Global Correlation:**
    *   **US Fed Rates:** The Ibovespa climbed 1.5% on January 28, 2026, as investors digested stable interest-rate settings from the US Federal Reserve.
    *   **China Stimulus:** Not directly mentioned in the search results, but it's reasonable to assume that China's economic activity and stimulus measures influence commodity prices (like iron ore) that are relevant to the Brazilian Utilities/Energy sector.
    *   **EU-Mercosur Agreement:** The EU-Mercosur trade agreement could strengthen Brazil's position as a strategic supplier of critical minerals, including lithium and rare earths, to Europe.

I have excluded any mention of ISA CTEEP and avoided "market commentary" as requested.
