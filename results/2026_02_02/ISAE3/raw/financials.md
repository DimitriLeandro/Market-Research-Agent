Okay, I understand. I will act as a Financial Auditor and Forensic Accountant and extract the requested financial data for ISAE3 from its most recent Quarterly Results (Earnings Release) and Management Guidance. I will then present the findings in a raw data log format, ensuring precision, explicit YoY comparisons (where available), and context regarding the drivers of change.
