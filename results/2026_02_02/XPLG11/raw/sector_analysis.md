Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Logistics sector in Brazil, focusing on the specified drivers and adhering to the output requirements.

Here's an analysis of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Logistics sector in Brazil:

*   **Commodity/Input Prices:**
    *   **Iron Ore:** On January 30, 2026, Iron Ore was at $105.62 USD/T. Over the past year, Iron Ore decreased 4.26%.
    *   **CBIO Prices:** As of June 12, 2025, the average CBIO price was R$59.50 ($10.70). Average CBIO trading prices are at their lowest levels since 2022.

*   **Interest Rates & Inflation:**
    *   **Selic Rate:** As of January 28, 2026, the Selic rate remains at 15.00%. The Central Bank of Brazil (Copom) is expected to keep the Selic rate at 15.00% per year.
    *   **Inflation (IPCA):** The 12-month cumulative IPCA rate closed 2025 at 4.26%.
    *   **Impact:** High interest rates are seen as stifling economic activity. A Selic rate of 15% makes many projects unfeasible.

*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   **ANP (Bio-LPG):** In January 2026, ANP granted authorizations for processing 100% renewable feedstock at a refining unit and for commercialization of Bio-LPG.
    *   **ANP (Natural Gas):** In December 2025, ANP approved a revised natural gas tariff regime clarifying capacity contracting rules and establishing a stable pricing mechanism for entry-exit transport operators.
    *   **Central Bank (Cryptoassets):** In December 2025, the Central Bank of Brazil published resolutions establishing a regulatory framework for virtual asset services, effective in February 2026.
    *   **Central Bank (Minimum Capital):** The Central Bank of Brazil updated minimum regulatory capital requirements for financial institutions, with a transition period from June 2026 to December 2027.
    *   **Biodiesel Imports:** As of January 2026, a cross-industry group is studying the role of ending the ban on biodiesel imports, but no recommendations have been made.
    *   **Tax Reform:** A tax reform was approved, aiming at unifying and reducing the number of taxes, simplifying tax laws, and providing for an actual VAT system. The new system will be subject to a transitional period from 2024 to 2032. The charge of the new taxes will begin in 2026.

*   **Global Correlation:**
    *   **US Fed Rates:** When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, US assets become more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real.
    *   **US Tariffs:** New tariffs imposed by the US may impact the Brazilian capital market. If a 50% tariff scenario becomes long-lasting, with an effective tariff of around 40%, Brazil's GDP could potentially be reduced by 0.6% to 1.0%.
    *   **EU-Brazil Trade:** Mutual adequacy decisions between the EU and Brazil will boost digital trade and save costs for companies.

*   **Market Growth:**
    *   The Brazil logistics market generated a revenue of USD 250.6 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 371.4 billion by 2030. The Brazil market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.8% from 2025 to 2030.
