Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic analysis of the Brazilian Agro/Land sector, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the current macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Brazilian Agro/Land sector:

*   **Iron Ore Prices:**
    *   On January 21, 2026, Brazilian 65% Fe iron ore fell from $124/mt to $118/mt CFR China. This was the steepest weekly drop in years.
    *   Analysts attributed this decline to the delivery of the first Simandou iron ore cargo to China and rising stockpiles at 35 Chinese ports.
    *   In the Brazilian domestic market on January 21, 2026, reference prices were $94/mt for the ore and $113/mt for pellets, ex-works and excluding taxes.
    *   Vale increased its iron ore production to 336mn t in 2025, a 2.6% increase compared to the previous year.
    *   Vale's iron ore fines prices averaged $91.6/t in 2025, down from $95.3/t in 2024.
    *   In December 2025, Brazil exported $2.93B of Iron Ore, with a 33% year-on-year increase.
*   **Brent Oil Prices:**
    *   The current price of Brent Oil futures is $66.05, with a previous close of $69.32.
    *   The 52-week price range for Brent Oil futures spans from $58.40 to $79.40.
    *   In the past year, the price of Brent Oil futures has changed by -13.19%.
*   **Pulp Prices:**
    *   Kraft Pulp fell to 5302 CNY/T on January 30, 2026, a 0.93% decrease from the previous day.
    *   Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 3.18% over the past month and is down 13.93% compared to the same time last year.
    *   In Q1, pulp prices in Latin America plummeted by 18%, putting direct pressure on forestry sector operating income and overall profits.
*   **CBIO Prices:**
    *   In October 2024, Cbio prices rose by 17% over two weeks to R91 ($16), the highest level since May.
    *   The CBIO first traded on June 12, 2020, and had an average price of Real 87.53/mtC02e until January 2, 2025.
    *   Average Cbio trading prices were at their lowest levels since 2022 as of June 16, 2025, with the average price at R59.30 ($10.70) on May 13, 2025.
*   **Interest Rates (Selic) and Inflation (IPCA):**
    *   The Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to keep the Selic rate at 15.00% per year.
    *   The 12-month cumulative IPCA rate closed 2025 at 4.26%.
    *   A Selic rate of 15% is considered the highest in nearly two decades.
    *   High Selic rate helps maintain the real's appreciation and reduces the cost of imported inputs but makes rural credit more expensive.
*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   The USDA's interim final rule for NEPA implementing procedures is effective July 3, 2025. Comments concerning this rule had to be received by July 30, 2025.
    *   The EPA and the U.S. Department of the Army are publishing for public comment a proposed rule revising the regulations defining the scope of waters federally covered under the Clean Water Act; the comment period closes January 5, 2026.
    *   Brazil expects to finish its SAF regulation by June 2026.
    *   Brazil's finance ministry will deliver a roadmap on phasing out fossil fuels on February 6.
    *   The revised National Water Amendment Bill, which was tabled again in Parliament in January 2026, proposes a prohibition on private water trading.
*   **Global Correlation:**
    *   Geopolitical tensions involving the U.S. have reinforced investor insecurity, resulting in a flight from U.S. assets and favoring other currencies, notably the Brazilian real.
    *   The U.S. economy remains resilient, contributing to reducing bets on additional rate cuts in the short term, including at the next Federal Reserve meeting.
    *   China is Brazil's largest agricultural trading partner, with soybean accounting for more than 60 percent of the country's agribusiness exports to China.
    *   Chinese investments often target raw material supply rather than value-adding practices.
    *   Increased demand from China for beef has been seen to put pressure on the Brazilian market by raising prices, encouraging livestock expansion, and deforestation.
    *   Upcoming expansion projects will help ensure that Brazilian pulp remains both competitive and readily available to meet US demand - particularly as China's import volumes decline due to rising domestic production and a slowing economy.
    *   The US-China tariff spat could raise Brazil deforestation risk.
