Okay, I will extract the requested financial data for RZTR11 from the most recent quarterly results, focusing on the specified metrics and comparisons.

Based on the search results, it's challenging to extract the specific hard financial data for the last reported quarter (vs. the same quarter last year) as requested. I am finding general information, dividend data, and some commentary, but not the detailed financial statement information needed for:

1.  **Top Line**: Net Revenue (Receita Líquida).
2.  **Operational**: EBITDA (Adjusted) and EBITDA Margin.
3.  **Bottom Line**: Net Income (Lucro Líquido) and Net Margin.
4.  **Cash Flow**: Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow.
5.  **Guidance**: Specific targets provided by management for the full year (Production, Capex, Costs).

Here's what I can gather:

*   **Dividend Information:** RZTR11 pays monthly dividends. The dividend yield is around 12.19%. For example, dividends of R$ 1.00 were paid monthly throughout much of 2025.
*   **Fund Strategy:** RZTR11 is a "hybrid" FII, investing in rural properties for agricultural production and other assets.
*   **Management Commentary:** Management revised the fund's target allocation, favoring assets in the "Land Equity" strategy.
*   **Recent Developments:** A sale commitment was made for R$18.5 million, with initial payments in November 2025 and further payments scheduled.
*   **Shareholder Returns:** From June 2021 to August 2025, RZTR11 outperformed the CDI index.
*   **Market Cap:** The market capitalization is R$1.85 billion.
*   **EPS (TTM):** Earnings per share (trailing twelve months) is R$0.00.

**I need access to the actual quarterly reports or earnings releases to fulfill the request completely.** I will continue searching for more specific financial data.
