Okay, I will construct an investment thesis for RZTR11, separating it into Bull and Bear case scenarios, focusing on the specified research objectives and adhering to the output requirements.

## RZTR11 Investment Thesis

### Bull Case (Upside)

1.  **Competitive Moat:** RZTR11 benefits from Riza's expertise in agricultural land management, which is considered one of the best in the industry. Riza Terrax employs a strategy of land equity, buying properties and leasing them, which accounts for 80% of their portfolio. The average lease rate is approximately 15% per year. The fund also has the ability to restructure farms, which can lead to significant profits.
2.  **Growth CapEx:** RZTR11 engages in strategic property acquisitions and sales to enhance profitability. For example, they sold a group of properties for R$108 million, generating a profit of R$41 million. They also entered into a purchase and sale commitment with Cedro Agripec, where they cover the farm's costs while Cedro continues its operations.
3.  **Debt & Solvency:** No verifiable data found for Net Debt/EBITDA ratio or debt maturity profile. Simply Wall St reports that they could not properly assess RZTR11's financial health due to a lack of adequate balance sheet data.
4.  **Ownership & Governance:** RZTR11 is managed by Riza Asset and administered by Plural S.A. Banco Múltiplo. XP Allocation Asset Management Ltda. is listed as a top shareholder. No verifiable data found for recent insider buying/selling, poison pills, or shareholder agreements.

### Bear Case (Downside)

1.  **Competitive Moat:** The fund's returns are closely tied to the Selic rate, making it less attractive when fixed-income rates are high.
2.  **Growth CapEx:** While strategic sales have been profitable, there are concerns about the transparency of how the proceeds are being utilized. For example, there are reports that the profits from a farm sale have not been reflected in the fund's financial statements.
3.  **Debt & Solvency:** No verifiable data found for Net Debt/EBITDA ratio or debt maturity profile. Simply Wall St reports that they could not properly assess RZTR11's financial health due to a lack of adequate balance sheet data.
4.  **Ownership & Governance:** There are reports of increased expenses that are not clearly explained in the fund's reports.
