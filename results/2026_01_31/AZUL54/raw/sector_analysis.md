Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Brazilian airline sector, focusing on external drivers and adhering to the specified format and constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural factors impacting the Brazilian airline sector:

*   **Jet Fuel Prices:**
    *   On January 27, 2026, the price of JET A1 fuel in Brazil was $88.8 per barrel.
    *   The price for Jet A1 per metric ton was $701.5, per gallon was $2.114, and per liter was $0.562.
    *   In September 2025, jet fuel prices in Brazil reached $2.138 USD/Gallon.
    *   Jet fuel expenses account for approximately 40% of an airline's total costs in Brazil, exceeding the global average of 30%.
    *   Even though 90% of jet fuel is produced in Brazil, its pricing follows international parity, adding pressure during periods of high external prices.

*   **Currency Exchange Rate:**
    *   A significant portion (57%) of airline expenses are in US dollars, including fuel, aircraft leases, and maintenance, while a large portion of revenue is in Reais.
    *   A weaker Real increases the financial burden of dollar-denominated expenses.

*   **Interest Rates and Inflation:**
    *   The Central Bank of Brazil is expected to maintain the Selic rate at 15.00% per year.
    *   High interest rates increase the cost of aircraft leases, financing, debt, and working capital.
    *   In 2024, the Real lost approximately 12% of its value against the dollar.
    *   The 12-month cumulative inflation rate closed 2025 at 4.26%.

*   **Regulatory Actions and Legislation:**
    *   In January 2025, ANAC's Resolution 743/2024 became effective, requiring air carriers to monitor CO2 emissions exceeding 10,000 tons in international flights annually.
    *   Law 15,042/2024 established the Brazilian Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading System, regulating the national carbon credit market, including the aviation sector.
    *   Amendment No. 13 to RBAC No. 21 was issued by ANAC, updating requirements for the design and manufacturing of aeronautical products.
    *   Law No. 14,034, enacted August 5, 2020, aimed to aid airlines during the COVID-19 pandemic by promoting changes in the regulatory environment.

*   **Market Share and Capacity:**
    *   Brazil is the fifth-largest domestic aviation market globally, but capacity remains approximately 9% below its 2015 peak.
    *   LATAM Airlines Group (38%), GOL (32%), and Azul (30%) dominate the domestic market.
    *   Domestic flight demand in Brazil grew 6.6% in 2024, outpacing the global average of 5.6%.
    *   Brazil has ascended to become the world's fourth-largest domestic flight market, capturing 1.2% of the global share.
    *   Passenger traffic surged across Brazil's airport network, surpassing previous pre-pandemic records.

*   **WTO Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft:**
    *   In 2023, Brazil joined the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, seeking to ensure import taxes on aircraft and aircraft parts are consolidated at zero.

*   **IATA Concerns:**
    *   IATA has stated that Brazil has some of the most expensive fuel in the world and has raised concerns about heavy taxes on kerosene.

*   **Public Debt:**
    *   Brazil's federal public debt is expected to reach between BRL 9.3 trillion and BRL 10.3 trillion by the end of 2026.

*   **Open Market:**
