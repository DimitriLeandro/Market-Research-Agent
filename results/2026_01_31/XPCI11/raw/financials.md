Okay, I understand. I will act as a Financial Auditor and Forensic Accountant, focusing on extracting the hard financial data for XPCI11 from its most recent Quarterly Results (Earnings Release) and Management Guidance. I will provide a raw data log with precise numbers, YoY comparisons (including % growth/decline), and context on the reasons for changes, if available.

Okay, I have gathered information on XPCI11. However, I couldn't find a recent earnings release with all the specific financial data points requested (Net Revenue, EBITDA, Net Income, Cash Flow, and Management Guidance) for a specific quarter. The search results provide general information about the fund, its dividend yield, portfolio allocation, and some performance metrics. I will provide the data I could extract, noting the limitations.
