Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic analysis of the Brazilian Paper/Receivables sector, focusing on external drivers and adhering to the specified format and constraints.

*   **Pulp Prices:**
    *   On January 28, 2026, Brazilian pulp maker Suzano announced it would increase pulp prices in February by $10 per metric ton for Asian clients (including China) and by $30 per ton for European and American clients.
    *   Kraft Pulp price was CNY 5302/T on January 30, 2026, a 0.93% decrease from the previous day. Over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 3.18%, and it is down 13.93% compared to the same time last year.
*   **Iron Ore Prices:**
    *   On December 4, 2025, Vale forecasted that iron ore prices would stabilize at around $100/ton in 2026.
    *   Iron Ore price was $105.62 USD/T on January 30, 2026, down 0.14% from the previous day. Over the past month, Iron Ore's price has fallen 1.41%, but it is still 3.97% higher than a year ago.
    *   On January 29, 2026, the China iron ore spot price was 798.50.
*   **Brent Oil Prices:**
    *   Brent Crude oil price equaled 70.70 dollars per 1 barrel in the beginning of February 2026.
    *   Brent rose to $69.82 USD/Bbl on January 30, 2026, up 0.33% from the previous day. Over the past month, Brent’s price has risen 14.74%, but it is still 7.73% lower than a year ago.
    *   The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects Brent crude to average $55.08 per barrel in 2026.
    *   On January 21, 2026, Brent crude oil prices jumped by $6/bbl to around $66/bbl in the early weeks of January before easing to $64/bbl.
*   **CBIO Prices:**
    *   I am unable to find information on CBIO prices.
*   **Interest Rates (Selic) and Inflation (IPCA):**
    *   On January 28, 2026, the Central Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) was expected to keep the Selic rate at 15.00% per year.
    *   December 2025 IPCA showed an acceleration of 0.33%, compared to 0.18% in the previous month. The 12-month cumulative rate closed 2025 at 4.26%, marking the second consecutive month within the tolerance bands.
    *   A potential rhetorical opening for the start of Brazil's Selic rate cut cycle as early as March could lower expectations for the Brazilian interest rate differential, reducing the relative attractiveness of domestic assets and putting depreciation pressure on the real.
    *   High interest rates may stifle economic activity.
*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   In October 2025, Brazil issued Decree No. 12,688, establishing mandatory reverse logistics systems for plastic packaging, with targets starting at 32% recovery in 2026. This impacts manufacturers, importers, distributors, and traders.
    *   ANEEL authorized the 2025 Electric Power Transmission Subsidies Plan (POTEE 2025) with investments of approximately BRL 1 billion in new transmission facilities over the next four years. The decision was formalized through Regulatory Order No. 200/2026.
    *   ANP updated the methodology for calculating the WACC for the next regulatory cycle, which will govern returns on regulated investments from 2026 to 2030.
    *   New MMA Ordinances reinforce rules and expand the scope of reverse logistics in Brazil.
*   **Global Correlation:**
    *   Expectations of steady U.S. interest rates, combined with the possibility of signaling a prolonged pause in rate cuts, are likely to sustain Treasury yields and favor the dollar globally.
    *   Increased U.S. involvement in external disputes has heightened perceptions of political instability in the country, driving a flight from U.S. assets and favoring currencies with higher interest rate differentials, such as the real.
    *   The Brazilian capital market is sensitive to external variables, and the increase in trade barriers may have consequences on Brazil's attractiveness to global investors.
*   **Paper Packaging Market Size:**
    *   The Brazil paper packaging market generated a revenue of USD 11,016.9 million in 2025 and is expected to reach USD 16,852.3 million by 2033. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.5% from 2026 to 2033.
*   **Wood Pulp Market Size:**
    *   The wood pulp market in Latin America and the Caribbean is forecast to grow to 14M tons and $11.3B by 2035.
