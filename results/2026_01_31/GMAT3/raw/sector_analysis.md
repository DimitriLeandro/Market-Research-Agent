Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Retail sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Retail sector in Brazil:

**1. Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Rice:** White rice prices decreased by 25.5% from January 2025 (R$ 7.15 per kilogram) to December 2025 (R$ 5.33 per kilogram).
*   **Beans:** Black beans prices dropped 31% from R$ 8.84 in January 2025 to R$ 6.10 in December 2025. Fradinho beans receded by 17%, moving from R$ 10.04 to R$ 8.33. Red beans saw a 14.5% decrease, going from R$ 14.89 to R$ 12.73.
*   **Coffee:** Forecasted rains for Brazil may cause coffee prices to retreat.

**2. Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **Selic Rate:** The Central Bank of Brazil (COPOM) maintained the benchmark Selic interest rate at 15.00% in January 2026. A prolonged hold is expected to maintain inflation on track amid uncertainty.
*   **Inflation (IPCA):** The annual inflation rate in Brazil eased to 4.26% in December 2025, the lowest since August 2024.
*   **Inflation Expectations:** Inflation expectations stand at 4.0% for 2026 and 3.8% for 2027.
*   **Retail Lending Spreads:** Central bank communications in 2025 emphasized a contractionary stance to ensure inflation convergence, sustaining higher retail lending spreads and cautious credit supply.

**3. Regulatory Actions:**

*   **ANEEL (National Electric Energy Agency):** ANEEL opened a Public Consultation to discuss improvements to regulations regarding retail sales. Discussions include market opening, relaxation of migration requirements for the Free Contracting Environment (ACL), and feasibility of aggregating measurement data.
*   **Central Bank:** The central bank's 2025–2026 agenda prioritized enhancements of open finance, payments security, and supervisory tooling.
*   **BCB (Banco Central do Brasil):** BCB published statistics on retail payments and cards in Brazil for the first half of 2024.

**4. Global Correlation:**

*   **US Fed Rate Decisions:** Expectations of steady U.S. interest rates may sustain Treasury yields and favor the dollar globally. A potential start to Brazil's Selic rate cut cycle as early as March could lower expectations for the Brazilian interest rate differential, reducing the attractiveness of domestic assets.
*   **US Economic Conditions:** External factors such as US economic conditions and global financial volatility continue to affect emerging markets.
*   **Brazilian Real:** The Brazilian Real touched 5.26 against the USD on January 27, 2026, the highest since June 2024.

**Additional Points:**

*   **Retail Sales Growth:** Retail Sales in Brazil increased 1.30 percent in November of 2025 over the same month in the previous year.
*   **Retail Market Size:** The Brazil retail market was USD 231.08 Billion in 2025 and is projected to grow at a 5.40% CAGR to USD 390.99 Billion by 2035.
*   **Household Consumption:** Household consumption increased by 4.8 percent in 2024.
*   **E-commerce:** Online sales accounted for 9% of all retail sales in 2024.
*   **Unemployment:** Brazil's unemployment rate was 5.1% in December 2025.
*   **Consumer Confidence:** Consumer optimism in Brazil dropped by five percentage points in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the last quarter of 2024.
