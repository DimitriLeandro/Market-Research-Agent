Okay, I will extract the requested financial data for XPLG11 from its most recent quarterly results and management guidance, focusing on the specified metrics and YoY comparisons. I will present the information as a raw data log with precise figures and explanations for any significant changes.

Based on the search results, I was unable to find the specific financial data points for the last reported quarter (vs. the same quarter last year) that you requested. The search results provide general information about XPLG11, including dividend yields, asset acquisitions, and analyses of the fund. However, they do not contain the hard financial data (Net Revenue, EBITDA, Net Income, Cash Flow) needed to fulfill your request.
