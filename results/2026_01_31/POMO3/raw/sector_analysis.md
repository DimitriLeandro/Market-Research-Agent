Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Industrial/Automotive sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Industrial/Automotive sector in Brazil, based on the research objectives:

**1. Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Iron Ore:** The price of Iron Ore 62% Fe CFR Futures is $105.62. Over the past year, the price of Iron Ore 62% futures has changed by 3.97%.
*   **Iron Ore (Brazil Port):** In August 2023, Iron Ore Fob (Fe 62% to 66%) in Corumbá, Brazil was priced at $165 USD.
*   **Brent Oil:** I do not have sufficient information to provide the current Brent Oil price.
*   **Pulp Prices:** I do not have sufficient information to provide the current Pulp prices.
*   **CBIOs (Carbon Credits):** The average CBIO price was R$59.30 ($10.70) on May 13, 2025, the lowest since September 2022. By June 12, 2025, the price had slightly recovered to R$59.50. Platts began publishing a price assessment for CBIOs in June 2024.

**2. Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **Selic Rate:** The Selic rate is at 15%. A rate cut is expected from March.
*   **Impact of Selic:** The Selic rate at 15% supports the Real by preserving attractive real yields and keeping carry flows intact.
*   **IPCA (Inflation):** Brazil's headline inflation decelerated to an annual 4.26% in December.

**3. Regulatory Actions:**

*   **ANP (National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels):** In September 2025, ANP increased the research octane number (Ron) of gasoline to 94 from 93 and settled other specifications. The decision came after increasing the anhydrous ethanol blend in fossil gasoline to 30% from 27%. In January 2026, ANP shut down Refit refinery over operational safety concerns.
*   **Camex (Chamber of Foreign Trade):** In March 2022, Camex regulated the reduction of the Import Tax on vehicles in the Brazilian market for up to two years. The import tax rate for vehicles will be 18% for SKD and 16% for CKD. In August 2025, Gecex-Camex officially approved a new tariff timeline for disassembled electric and hybrid vehicles, marking a significant change in the import landscape for OEMs.
*   **New "Mover" Program:** The Brazilian federal government's new program for Green Mobility and Innovation called Mover, includes an average of US$ 800 million in incentives for companies that invest in decarbonization operations between 2024 and 2028 and aims to reach more than US$ 2 billion in tax credits by its end.
*   **Vehicle Emission Standards:** Environmental agencies such as the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) in collaboration with DENATRAN, ensure that vehicles meet specified limits for pollutants.
*   **Hybrid Vehicle Certification:** In 2025, Umicore obtained the new ISO guide required for hybrid vehicle certification, now mandatory for homologation.
*   **EU-Mercosur Agreement:** The free trade agreement between Mercosur and the European Union, signed in January 17, 2026, establishes a schedule for tariff reductions that could lower the cost of importing European vehicles into Brazil. Currently, the Brazilian tariff for importing automobiles from Europe is 35%.
*   **Automotive Package (European Commission):** In December 2025, the European Commission presented the Automotive Package, a set of interlinked legislative and policy initiatives aimed at supporting the European automotive sector's transition to clean mobility.

**4. Global Correlation:**

*   **China:** Brazilian chassis manufacturers are currently unable to meet the pressure of demand for electric buses, which would result in the importation of chassis from, most likely, Chinese suppliers who dominate this market worldwide.
*   **US Fed Rates:** Investors are awaiting the results of the US Federal Reserve's first policy meeting of the year on Wednesday, which is widely expected to result in no change for the fed funds rate.
*   **US Tariffs:** The U.S. tariff shift is shaking up Brazil's automotive sector.

I have excluded any commentary or subjective statements as requested.
