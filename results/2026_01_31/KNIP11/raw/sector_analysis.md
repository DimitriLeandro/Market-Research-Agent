Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Paper/Receivables sector in Brazil, focusing on the external environment and adhering to the specified constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural factors affecting the Paper/Receivables sector in Brazil, as of January 31, 2026:

**Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Pulp Prices:** On January 28, 2026, Brazilian pulp maker Suzano announced it would increase pulp prices in February by $10 per metric ton for Asian clients, including China, and by $30 per ton for clients in Europe and the Americas. Kraft Pulp was at 5302 CNY/T on January 30, 2026, a 0.93% decrease from the previous day. Over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 3.18%, and is down 13.93% compared to the same time last year.
*   **Iron Ore Spot Price:** Iron Ore fell to 105.62 USD/T on January 30, 2026, down 0.14% from the previous day. Over the past month, Iron Ore's price has fallen 1.41%, but it is still 3.97% higher than a year ago. Vale forecasts iron ore prices at $100/ton in 2026.
*   **Brent Oil:** Brent Crude rose to $69.82 USD/Bbl on January 30, 2026, up 0.33% from the previous day. Over the past month, Brent's price has risen 14.74%, but it is still 7.73% lower than a year ago. The EIA projects Brent crude to average $55.08 per barrel in 2026. Standard Chartered report projected that the ICE Brent nearby future crude oil price will average $63.50 per barrel in 2026.
*   **CBIOs:** I am unable to find information on CBIO prices.

**Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **SELIC Rate:** As of January 26, 2026, the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to keep the Selic rate at 15.00% per year. Concerns exist within the Brazilian productive sector that maintaining the Selic rate at 15% stifles economic activity. High interest rates are identified by 80% of industrial companies as the main obstacle to short-term credit.
*   **IPCA:** The most recent inflation data, the National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) for December, showed an acceleration of 0.33%, compared to 0.18% in the previous month. Despite the acceleration, the 12-month cumulative rate closed 2025 at 4.26%, marking the second consecutive month within the tolerance bands.

**Regulatory Actions:**

*   **Tax Reform:** Brazil's Tax Reform 2026–2032 introduces a phased replacement of multiple indirect taxes with a dual VAT system (CBS at the federal level and IBS at the state and municipal levels), aiming to simplify taxation and eliminate cascading effects. From 2026, CBS and IBS are introduced in a pilot phase at very low rates—0.9% for CBS and 0.1% for IBS—without immediately abolishing existing taxes.
*   **Financial Investments Tax:** Provisional Measure No. 1,303/2025, increased the taxation of Interest on Net Equity (INE) payments from 15% to 20%, effective January 1, 2026. The measure introduces a 5% withholding tax on income from certain financial investments related to real estate and agribusiness, effective from January 1, 2026.
*   **Senate Approved Tax Hike Package:** On December 17, 2025, Brazil's Senate approved draft legislation to reduce tax breaks for several sectors and to raise the tax burden on online sports betting wagers, on fintech firms, and on interest on equity.
*   **Software Fiscalization:** A federal rule requires that, by 2026, a software model must be mandatory in all states and that the sale, development, and use of hardware-based fiscal devices such as fiscal printers, SAT, and MFE will no longer be permitted.
*   **Financial Regulatory Developments:** More extensive capital reforms are expected in 2026. The agencies have previewed that they intend to issue a revised rule to implement the Basel III reforms by early 2026 and to tackle other areas including the surcharge applicable to GSIBs.

**Global Correlation:**

*   **US Fed Rate impact:** Expectations of steady U.S. interest rates, combined with the possibility of signaling a prolonged pause in rate cuts, are likely to sustain Treasury yields and favor the dollar globally.
*   **China stimulus impact:** I am unable to find information on China stimulus impact.
*   **US Tariffs:** On July 9, 2025, the US President announced plans to impose a 50% tariff on all imports from Brazil, with the new policy slated to take effect August 1, 2025. In response, the Brazilian government stated it would take reciprocal measures, citing its newly enacted Trade Reciprocity Law.
