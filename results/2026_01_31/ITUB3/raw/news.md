Here's a forensic log of material events for ITUB3 (Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A.) from the last 90 days:

*   **[2025-12-18] Bonificação in Shares**: Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A. announced that its Board of Directors approved a capital increase of R$ 12,846,837,880.00 within the limit of the authorized capital, increasing it from R$ 124,063,060,190.00 to R$ 136,909,898,070.00 through capitalization of retained earnings. This will result in a bonus share issue at a ratio of 3%, with 321,170,947 new shares being issued (163,623,582 ordinary and 157,547,365 preferred). Shareholders will receive 3 new shares for every 100 shares held. The record date was December 23, 2025, in Brazil and December 29, 2025, in the United States. The new shares will be available for trading "ex" bonus rights from December 26, 2025, in Brazil and will be included in shareholders' positions on December 30, 2025. The bonus share issue does not alter the company's net equity. Monthly JCP will be maintained at R$ 0.01765 per share (net value of R$ 0.015 per share), so that the total amounts paid by the Company monthly to shareholders will be increased by 3% after the inclusion of bonus shares in the shareholding position. The minimum annual dividend guaranteed to preferred shares will also be maintained at R$ 0.022 per share.

*   **[2024-06-06] JCP Payment**: Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A. informed shareholders that its Board of Directors approved the payment of JCP (interest on equity) in the amount of R$ 0.2510 per share, with a 15% withholding income tax, resulting in net interest of R$ 0.21335 per share. The calculation base will be the final shareholding position recorded on June 20, 2024, with shares traded "ex-rights" from June 21, 2024. The Board of Directors also approved that the JCP declared today, as well as the JCP already declared on March 4, 2024 (based on the shareholding position of March 21, 2024), will be paid jointly on August 30, 2024, in a total net amount of R$ 0.41888 per share.
