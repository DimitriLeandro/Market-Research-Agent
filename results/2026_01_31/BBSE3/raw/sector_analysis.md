Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Brazilian insurance sector, focusing on external drivers and adhering to the specified format and constraints.

Here's an analysis of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Brazilian insurance sector:

### Commodity/Input Prices:

*   **CBIO Prices:** As of June 12, 2025, the average CBIO price was R$59.50 ($10.70). On May 13, 2025, the average CBIO price was R$59.30 ($10.70), the lowest since September 2022, when it hit R$61.20. CBIO prices are influenced by the RenovaBio program targets. Platts proposed incorporating CBIO prices into assessments of Brazilian ethanol in March 2025.
*   **Trend**: CBIO trading prices are at their lowest levels since 2022, reflecting insecurity caused by sector defaults and oversupply from suppressed demand.

### Interest Rates & Inflation:

*   **Selic Rate:** The Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to maintain the Selic rate at 15.00% per year. There are expectations that Copom may signal the start of a rate-cut cycle as early as March.
*   **Impact of Selic:** A potential start to Brazil's Selic rate cut cycle could lower expectations for the Brazilian interest rate differential, reducing the relative attractiveness of domestic assets and potentially depreciating the Real. Rising interest rates support investment income and create more attractive investment opportunities for insurers.
*   **IPCA (Inflation):** December 2025 saw an acceleration of the IPCA to 0.33%, compared to 0.18% in the previous month. The 12-month cumulative rate closed 2025 at 4.26%, marking the second consecutive month within the tolerance bands.
*   **Inflation Target:** The National Monetary Council (CMN) set an inflation target of 3 percent for 2024, with a tolerance margin of 1.5 percentage points. The Central Bank forecasts IPCA will reach 4.9 percent in 2024, 4.5 percent in 2025, and 4 percent for the 12-month period ending in the second quarter of 2026.

### Regulatory Actions:

*   **New Insurance Contract Law (Law No. 15.040/2024):** This law, also called the Brazilian Insurance Act, took effect on December 11, 2025, revoking provisions of the Brazilian Civil Code and some articles of Decree-Law n°73/1966. It introduces stricter timelines for insurer and reinsurer responses, improves claims transparency, and restricts unilateral policy cancellations. The law also limits the ability to apply foreign law and jurisdictions in insurance and reinsurance disputes.
*   **SUSEP Regulations:** SUSEP is expected to issue enabling regulations for the new Insurance Act. SUSEP launched a public consultation on a draft resolution intended to replace Circular SUSEP No. 621/2021, seeking to align the regulatory framework governing non-life insurance with the principles introduced by the new legislation.
*   **IOF Tax Changes:** On May 22, 2025, the Brazilian Federal Government issued Decree No. 12,466/2025, increasing the rates of the Tax on Financial Transactions (IOF) applicable to credit, foreign exchange, and insurance transactions. A 5% IOF rate will be levied if individual contributions to life insurance policies with a survival benefit exceed BRL 600,000 in total annual contributions made to one or more insurance companies starting January 1, 2026. The IOF rate on foreign exchange transactions for the transfer of funds abroad increased from 0.38% to 3.5%, affecting reinsurance premiums remitted to international reinsurers.
*   **CNSP Resolution 451/2022:** Effective from January 1, 2023, this resolution amended the maximum reinsurance cessions for local insurers. Local insurers must submit to SUSEP a technical justification for a reinsurance cession percentage higher than 90%.

### Global Correlation:

*   **US Fed Rates:** Expectations of steady U.S. interest rates are likely to sustain Treasury yields and favor the dollar globally.
*   **China Stimulus:** China's economic stimulus package is expected to trigger ripple effects across the global market, influencing global demand for commodities, industrial goods, and services. China will likely balance stimulus and reform with its 15th Five-Year Plan.
*   **Global Trade:** Industrials in Latin America may benefit from a western realignment of US trade.
*   **US Dollar Weakening:** The US dollar index (DXY) has fallen, reflecting political uncertainty in the US and expectations of continued interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
*   **Foreign Investment:** Foreign investors increased their share of the financial volume traded on Brazil's main stock exchange (B3) in 2024, reaching 55.8 percent, the highest level since 2019.
*   **Commodity Prices:** A divergence in commodity prices, with strong demand supporting metals and agricultural products while excess supply pressures oil prices, will be felt in corporate earnings.
