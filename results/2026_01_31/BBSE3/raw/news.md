**[2025-11-10] Sell-Side Activity:** JPMorgan downgraded BB Seguridade (BBSE3) to underweight (equivalent to sell) from equal-weight (neutral), reducing the target price from R$ 40 to R$ 34 per share. This was based on expectations of low single-digit growth in earned premiums in 2026 and 2027, and pressure on financial revenue due to falling Selic rates. They project a 3% fall in profit in 2026, followed by a 3% recovery in 2027, which is about 2% below consensus for 2026. JPMorgan highlights that BBSE may pay 11% yield in the next year, but it is not enough to offset the risk and generate a good return.
