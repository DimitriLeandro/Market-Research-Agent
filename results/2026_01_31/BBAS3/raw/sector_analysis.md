Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Financials sector in Brazil, focusing on the external environment and adhering to the specified constraints.

Here's a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Financials sector in Brazil, focusing on the external environment:

*   **Selic Rate:** As of January 2026, the Selic rate, Brazil's monetary policy interest rate, remained at 15%. The Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to maintain this rate.

*   **IPCA Inflation:** The National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) for December 2025 showed an acceleration of 0.33%, compared to 0.18% in the previous month. The 12-month cumulative rate closed 2025 at 4.26%, marking the second consecutive month within the tolerance bands.

*   **Central Bank Regulatory Priorities:** On April 24, 2025, the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) announced its regulatory priorities for 2025 and 2026, which include the evolution of Open Finance, virtual asset regulations, monitoring artificial intelligence usage, and the expansion of Pix's functionalities.

*   **Taxation of Interest on Net Equity (INE):** Provisional Measure No. 1,303/2025, published on June 11, 2025, increased the taxation of Interest on Net Equity (INE) payments from 15% to 20%, effective January 1, 2026.

*   **Tax on Financial Investments:** Effective January 1, 2026, a 5% withholding tax was introduced on income from certain financial investments related to real estate and agribusiness.

*   **Tax on Betting Operations:** The tax rate on online betting operations increased from 12% to 18% starting October 1, 2025.

*   **IOF-FX Rate:** Decree No. 12,499/2025 reduced the IOF-FX rate on the return of foreign investment to 0%, effective immediately as of June 11, 2025.

*   **Tax Benefits Reduction:** A bill approved in the Chamber of Deputies reduces federal tax incentives by 10%, with changes mostly taking effect from January 1, 2026.

*   **Fintech Tax Hike:** Brazil's Senate Economic Affairs Committee approved a legislative proposal to increase taxes on fintechs, payment institutions, and stock exchanges from the current 9% to 12% in 2026, reaching 15% by 2028.

*   **Consumption Tax Reform:** On January 14, 2026, Complementary Law No. 227/2026 was published, marking the second stage of implementation of the Consumption Tax Reform.

*   **China Stimulus Impact:** Disappointment in China's stimulus package in October 2024 led to a downturn in the Brazilian stock market, Ibovespa, with the index closing 0.38% lower. Iron ore and oil prices plummeted by over 4%.

*   **US Fed Rate Hikes:** When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, US assets become more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real. This depreciation increases the cost of importing inputs and raises financing costs for Brazilian companies, reducing their investment capacity.

*   **US Tariffs Impact:** A 50% tariff imposed by the US on Brazil could potentially reduce Brazil's GDP by 0.6% to 1.0%, though this impact could be mitigated by diversifying exports to other countries.

*   **Central Bank Measures to Improve Security:** On September 5, 2025, the Brazilian Central Bank (BCB) issued measures to strengthen the safety of the country's National Financial System, aiming to establish security and governance criteria. Non-authorized payment institutions must apply for BCB accreditation to operate within Brazil's Pix instant payment system between January 1, 2026, and May 1, 2026.

*   **New Capital Requirements:** In early November 2025, the Central Bank of Brazil published Joint Resolution No. 14/2025 and Resolution No. 517/2025, amending the criteria for calculating minimum paid-in capital and minimum net worth required of financial institutions. For institutions already authorized to operate, the Central Bank established a transition period beginning in June 2026 and ending in December 2027, allowing for gradual compliance with the new minimum threshold for paid-in capital and net worth.
