### Interest Rates & Inflation

*   **Selic Rate:** On **January 28, 2026**, Brazil's central bank maintained its target rate at 15%. This followed similar decisions since **June 2025**, after seven increases that raised the rate from a cyclical low of 10.5% in **September 2024**. The Selic rate ended 2024 at 12.25%.
*   **IPCA (Inflation):** The annual inflation rate in Brazil decreased to 4.26% in **December 2025**. In **November 2025**, the rate was 4.46%. The Central Bank's projected inflation is 3.5%.
*   **Impact:** High interest rates are seen as a cause for caution in the investment environment. High interest rates make mortgage credit more expensive and discourage new construction projects.

### Regulatory Actions

*   **Municipal Regulations:** According to the Brazilian legal regime, the use and occupation of land, as well as urban zoning, are regulated by municipal rules. As a rule, there is no specific regulation applicable to shopping centers.
*   **Construction Permits:** Prior to the beginning of construction works, it is mandatory to obtain a Construction Permit from the competent municipality, which allows for obtaining the Occupancy Certificate once construction works are completed.
*   **Operating Permits:** Shopping centers require a fire inspection certificate, as well as an operating permit issued by the local municipality for regular operation.
*   **Trump's Tariffs:** In **2025**, a 50% tariff was imposed on many Brazilian goods by the U.S..

### Global Correlation

*   **China:** Chinese companies invested $2.2 billion in Brazil in the first six months of **2025**. This represents a 5% increase compared to the same period a year earlier.
*   **US Fed Rates:** The uncertain global environment due to US policies and their repercussions on global financial markets was cited by Brazil's central bank as a reason to hold the target rate unchanged at 15% in its first meeting of **2026**.
*   **US Tariffs:** The 50% tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Brazilian goods are pushing China and Brazil closer together.
*   **Global Economy:** The IMF forecasts global real GDP growth of 3.3% for 2026.
