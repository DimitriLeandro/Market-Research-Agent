Okay, I will act as a Financial Auditor and Forensic Accountant and provide the financial data log for VISC11 based on the most recent Quarterly Results (Earnings Release) and Management Guidance, focusing on the specified metrics and comparisons. I will extract the hard financial data and present it in the requested format.
Based on the search results, here's the financial data log for VISC11. I will continue searching for the specific numbers requested.
