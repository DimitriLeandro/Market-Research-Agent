Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Brazilian Financials sector, focusing on external drivers and adhering to the specified format and constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers impacting the Brazilian Financials sector:

**1. Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Iron Ore:** On January 30, 2026, Iron Ore was priced at $105.62 USD/T, a 0.14% decrease from the previous day. Over the past month, the price has fallen 1.41%, but it is 3.97% higher than a year ago.
*   **Pulp Prices:** Kraft Pulp fell to 5302 CNY/T on January 30, 2026, a 0.93% decrease from the previous day. Over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 3.18%, and is down 13.93% compared to the same time last year. Suzano announced that they will be increasing pulp prices in February by $10 per metric ton for its clients in Asia, including China, while hiking up prices by $30 per ton in Europe and the Americas.
*   **CBIOs (Carbon Credits):** The average CBIO price was R$59.30 ($10.70) on May 13, 2025, its lowest since September 2022. By June 12, 2025, the price had slightly recovered to R$59.50. In June 2024, the average price was Real 87.53/mtC02e.

**2. Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **Selic Rate:** As of January 2026, the Selic rate remains at 15.00% per year. The Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) is expected to maintain this rate at its meeting on January 28, 2026. There are expectations that Copom may signal the start of a rate-cut cycle as early as March.
*   **IPCA (Inflation):** The 12-month cumulative IPCA rate closed 2025 at 4.26%, which is within the tolerance bands. The National Monetary Council (CMN) has set the inflation target at 3.00% starting in January 2025, with a tolerance interval of ± 1.50 percentage points.

**3. Regulatory Actions:**

*   **IOF Tax Changes (May 2025):** Decree 12.466/2025, published on May 22, 2025, significantly increased tax rates on credit transactions (IOF-credit) and foreign exchange transactions (IOF-FX), effective from May 23, 2025. The changes also roll back previous attempts to effectively remove IOF-FX by January 2, 2029.
*   **Central Bank Virtual Asset Regulations (January 2026):** BCB Instruction No. 701/2026 complements BCB Resolution No. 520/2025 and establishes requirements for independent technical certification for virtual asset intermediation and custody services.
*   **Central Bank Payment Account Regulations (November 2025):** On November 11, 2025, the BCB issued Resolution No 518, amending the rules on opening, maintaining, and closing payment accounts. The new regulation strengthens safeguards against irregular practices and mandates compulsory closure of accounts misusing funds. It came into effect on December 1, 2025.
*   **Pix Requirements (September 2025):** BCB Resolution No. 496 amended BCB Resolution No. 1/2020, changing aspects of the Pix payment scheme. Non-authorized payment institutions must apply for BCB accreditation to operate within Brazil's Pix system between January 1, 2026, and May 1, 2026.
*   **Consumption Tax Reform (January 2026):** Complementary Law No. 227/2026 was published on January 14, 2026, marking the second stage of implementation of the Consumption Tax Reform.

**4. Global Correlation:**

*   **US Fed Rate Hikes:** When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, US assets become more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real. This depreciation increases the cost of importing inputs and raises financing costs for Brazilian companies.
*   **US Tariffs:** New tariffs imposed by the US could impact Brazil's attractiveness to global investors. A long-lasting 50% tariff scenario with an effective tariff of around 40% could reduce Brazil's GDP by 0.6% to 1.0%.
*   **China Stimulus:** Strong recovery of the Chinese economy has a positive knock-on effect on Brazilian exports.
*   **Geopolitical Tensions:** Increased U.S. involvement in external disputes has heightened perceptions of political instability in the country, driving a flight from U.S. assets and favoring currencies with higher interest rate differentials, such as the real.
