Okay, I will extract the requested financial data for GARE11 from its most recent quarterly results and management guidance, focusing on the specified metrics and comparisons.

Based on the search results, it appears difficult to extract the specific financial data points requested (Net Revenue, EBITDA, Net Income, Cash Flow) for the most recent quarter and YoY comparison. The search results provide general information about GARE11, including dividend yields, market capitalization, and some discussion of recent changes and strategies. However, they do not contain the detailed financial statement information needed to fulfill the request.

I am unable to provide the raw data log as requested.
