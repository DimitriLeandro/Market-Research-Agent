### Interest Rates & Inflation:

### Regulatory Actions:

*   **ANP (National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels):** In December 2025, ANP approved a revised natural gas tariff regime, clarifying capacity contracting rules and establishing a stable pricing mechanism for entry-exit transport operators.
