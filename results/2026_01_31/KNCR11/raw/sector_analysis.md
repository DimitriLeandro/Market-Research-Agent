Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Paper/Receivables sector in Brazil, focusing on the external environment and adhering to the specified format and constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Paper/Receivables sector in Brazil, as of January 31, 2026:

### Commodity/Input Prices

*   **Pulp Prices:** Suzano, a Brazilian pulp maker, announced it would increase pulp prices in February 2026 by $10 per metric ton for Asian clients (including China) and by $30 per ton for clients in Europe and the Americas. Kraft Pulp was at 5302 CNY/T on January 30, 2026, a 0.93% decrease from the previous day. Over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 3.18%, and is down 13.93% compared to the same time last year.
*   **Iron Ore Spot Price:** On January 30, 2026, Iron Ore fell to 105.62 USD/T, down 0.14% from the previous day. Over the past month, Iron Ore's price has fallen 1.41%, but it is still 3.97% higher than a year ago. Vale forecasts iron ore prices will stabilize around $100/t in 2026.
*   **Brent Oil:** Brent rose to 69.82 USD/Bbl on January 30, 2026, up 0.33% from the previous day. Over the past month, Brent's price has risen 14.74%, but it is still 7.73% lower than a year ago. The EIA projects Brent crude to average $56 per barrel in 2026.
*   **CBIOs:** No specific CBIO (Certificados de Descarbonização) prices were found in the search results.

### Interest Rates & Inflation

*   **Selic Rate Impact:** Brazil's Selic rate was at 15% in 2024, which is among the highest of major economies. A 1 percentage point increase in the policy rate raises lending rates by around 0.7 percentage points after four months. High interest rates are seen as a major obstacle to short-term credit by 80% of industrial companies.
*   **IPCA Impact:** In February, Extended National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) inflation fell to 4.50% year-on-year from a peak of 12.13% in April 2022.

### Regulatory Actions

*   **Central Bank of Brazil (BCB):** BCB Instruction No. 701/2026 complements BCB Resolution No. 520/2025 and establishes requirements for independent technical certification for virtual asset intermediation and custody services. The BCB announced its regulatory priorities for 2025 and 2026, including the evolution of Open Finance, virtual asset regulations, monitoring artificial intelligence usage, and the expansion of Pix's functionalities.
*   **Tax Reform:** Complementary Law No. 227/2026 was published on January 14, 2026, containing additional regulations for the Tax Reform on Consumption. 2026 marks the beginning of the tax reform test phase, under which taxpayers are obliged to issue invoices stating CBS and IBS at a combined rate of 1% (0.9% for CBS and 0.1% for IBS) but are exempt from paying these taxes if the ancillary tax obligations are complied with.
*   **ANP:** Brazil produced 8.9mn m³ of biodiesel in January-November 2025, according to data from hydrocarbons regulator ANP.

### Global Correlation

*   **China Stimulus:** The animal-protein rebound will support corrugated boxes and board shipments in Brazil. Markets such as the US and China, which had restrictions, are reopening to Brazilian beef, poultry and pork.
*   **US Fed Rates:** When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, US assets become more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real. This depreciation increases the cost of importing inputs and raises financing costs for Brazilian companies, reducing their investment capacity.
