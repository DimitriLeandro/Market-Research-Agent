Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Utilities/Energy sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Utilities/Energy sector in Brazil, as of January 31, 2026:

**1. Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **CBIOs (Brazilian Decarbonization Credits):** In June 2025, the average CBIO price was R$59.30 ($10.70) on May 13, 2025, the lowest since September 2022. It recovered slightly to R$59.50 on June 12, 2025. Platts proposed incorporating the price of Brazilian CBIO carbon credits into its assessments of Brazilian ethanol in March 2025. As of January 2026, CBIOs were trading at R$ 29,90.
*   **Electricity:** The average electricity price in Brazil decreased from ~$131/MWh in 2023 to ~$130/MWh in 2024. However, electricity prices for households in Brazil was approximately 0.921 BRL per kWh in May 2025, a 6.1% increase over the previous month and a 3.4% rise year-on-year. The price for electricity for the industrial sector in Brazil stood at around 0.926 BRL per kWh in May 2025. This was a 3.9% increase compared to the previous month, and a 9.1% increase year-on-year.
*   **Energy (General):** The average current price of energy from electricity was $268.117 USD/BOE in 2023, an increase from $261.376 USD/BOE in 2022.

**2. Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **Selic Rate:** As of January 28, 2026, Brazil's central bank held its target Selic rate unchanged at 15%. This decision follows a series of holds since June 2025, after seven increases that brought the rate up from a low of 10.5% in September 2024.
*   **Inflation (IPCA):** Brazil's headline inflation decelerated to an annual 4.26% in December. Inflation expectations remain above target, at 4% and 3.8% for 2026 and 2027, respectively. Residential electricity prices rose 10.18% from January to July 2025.
*   **Impact on Sector:** High interest rates are burdening the Brazilian economy, while infrastructure requires significant investment. Rising financial expenses and potential macro-driven delinquency risks are present. The cost of debt continues to test companies’ financial resilience.

**3. Regulatory Actions:**

*   **ANEEL (National Electric Energy Agency):** ANEEL cancelled 509 permits for solar PV and wind power projects during 2025, representing approximately 22 GW of planned capacity. ANEEL set the power clearing price (PLD) thresholds for 2023 at R$69.04-678.29/MWh ($13.07-130/MWh). ANEEL is expected to implement changes to the White Hourly Tariff, potentially migrating low-voltage consumers consuming more than 1,000 kWh/month to this model by the end of 2026.
*   **Central Bank of Brazil (BCB):** In April 2025, the BCB announced its regulatory priorities for 2025 and 2026, including the evolution of Open Finance, virtual asset regulations, monitoring artificial intelligence usage, and the expansion of Pix's functionalities. New regulations regarding virtual assets are expected in the second half of 2025. The BCB is expected to enact Banking as a Service (BaaS) regulations by the end of 2025. The Central Bank established a transition period beginning in June 2026 and ending in December 2027 for financial institutions to comply with new minimum regulatory capital requirements.
*   **New Legislation:** Law No. 15,097/2025 implements the new regulation for offshore wind generation in Brazil.

**4. Global Correlation:**

*   **US Fed Rate Hikes:** When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, it strengthens the dollar against other currencies, including the real. This decreases Brazil's purchasing power on the international market.
*   **US Policies:** The Central Bank of Brazil cited an uncertain global environment due to US policies and their repercussions on global financial markets as a reason for holding the Selic rate.
*   **China Stimulus:** I am unable to find information about the specific effects of China's stimulus on the Utilities/Energy sector in Brazil.
*   **Global Energy Transition:** Brazil's power sector is a source of carbon credits for other sectors in Brazil and the world. Brazil has been experiencing a surge in metal and mining companies procuring power purchase agreements from non-fossil fuel power generation sources, potentially to comply with the EU and US 'Global Arrangement on Sustainable Steel and Aluminium'.
