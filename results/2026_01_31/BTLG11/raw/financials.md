Okay, I will extract the requested financial data from the most recent quarterly results and management guidance for BTLG11, focusing on the specified metrics and comparisons. I will present the information as a raw data log with precise numbers and context on the changes.

Okay, I have gathered some information on BTLG11. However, I need the actual quarterly results to fulfill the request. I will proceed assuming the most recent quarter is 4Q25 (October-December 2025) and will look for data related to that period and compare it to 4Q24 (October-December 2024). Since I don't have access to specific reports, I will use available data and clearly state the limitations.
