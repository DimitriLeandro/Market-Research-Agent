Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Agriculture sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers impacting the Agriculture sector in Brazil:

*   **Commodity/Input Prices:**
    *   In the September-October period, the average price of farmland in Brazil reached R$17,561.03 per hectare, a 31.04% increase over the last 12 months, according to IHS Markit.
    *   Pasture farmland gained 17.64% in value in the last year, reaching an average price of R$10,672 per hectare.
    *   Grain cultivation areas increased by 44.52% in the last year, with an average price of R$41,144.
    *   In 2025, soybeans traded between 110 and 145 reais per sack, a decrease from around 200 reais per sack in 2022.
    *   During the first half of the crop year, fertilizer prices declined by 24% from their 2022 peak, influencing pre-purchases.

*   **Interest Rates & Inflation:**
    *   In August 2023, the central bank began cutting interest rates after early action on inflation reduction.
    *   The National Monetary Council set a 3% inflation target for 2024.
    *   A Selic rate of 15% in 2025 constrained farmers from taking on loans, leading them to focus on working capital.
    *   Farmers filed 700 recovery requests in the first half of 2025, compared to 320 in the same period of 2024, influenced by high borrowing costs.
    *   Domestic food inflation rose from -1.3% y/y in late-2023 to 8.4% y/y in November, driven by drought-affected harvests and grazing areas.
*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   Brazil introduced Law 15.070/2024 to promote the use of bio-inputs and establish a framework for eco-friendly farming practices.
    *   In June 2025, the Brazilian Senate approved Bill No. 2,159/2021, proposing a unified national framework for environmental licensing.
    *   The Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply (MAPA) is spearheading a revision of pesticide management regulations.
    *   In June 2025, the National Congress of Brazil concluded the processing of the new regulatory framework for agricultural pesticides, marking the final approval of PL 1.459/2022, which became Law No. 14.785/2023.

*   **Global Correlation:**
    *   In 2021, China accounted for 39% of Brazil's total agricultural exports and 70% of its soybean exports.
    *   The United States imposed 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods in August 2025, potentially leading to annual losses of $5.8 billion.
    *   The Brazil agriculture market size is projected to grow from USD 132.62 billion in 2026 to USD 166.42 billion in 2031, registering a CAGR of 4.65%, driven by demand from China and Southeast Asia.
    *   The United States is likely to face high inflation and a decline in industrial output in the coming years, which could lead to new tariff hikes, including on Brazil.
    *   Brazil was the second-biggest grain exporter in the world in 2024, with 19% of the international market share.
