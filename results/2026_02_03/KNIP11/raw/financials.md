Okay, I will act as a Financial Auditor and Forensic Accountant to extract the requested financial data for KNIP11. I will focus on the most recent quarterly results, comparing them to the same quarter last year (YoY), and extract management's guidance for the full year. I will then present the findings in a raw data log format, including explicit percentage changes and explanations for significant variances.

Based on the search results, it's challenging to extract precise, hard financial data for the most recent quarter (specifically, Q4 2025 or Q1 2026) compared to the same quarter last year (YoY) for KNIP11. The results provide general information, dividend yields, and some portfolio allocation details, but not the specific figures needed for a comprehensive financial audit.

Here's what I can gather and present in the requested format, keeping in mind the limitations:

*   At the end of December, the fund had 103.1% of its net worth allocated to target assets and 7.4% in cash instruments. The invested portion in CRI has a rate of IPCA + 10.32% p.a. and a duration of 3.8 years.

**Disclaimer:** This data log is based on the available search results and may not reflect a complete or fully accurate financial picture of KNIP11. The absence of key financial figures (Revenue, EBITDA, Net Income, Cash Flow) limits the ability to perform a proper YoY comparison and assess the fund's financial performance. To get the complete picture, it is recommended to consult official financial reports from Kinea Investimentos.
