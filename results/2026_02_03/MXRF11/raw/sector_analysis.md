Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Hybrid/Paper sector in Brazil, focusing on the external environment and adhering to the specified constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Hybrid/Paper sector in Brazil, based on the search results:

**1. Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Iron Ore:** On February 4, 2026, Iron Ore traded at 102.16 USD/T. Over the past month, the price has fallen 3.74%, and it is down 2.53% compared to the same time last year. Vale forecasts iron ore prices to stabilize around $100/t in 2026.
*   **Brent Oil:** On February 4, 2026, Brent rose to 67.52 USD/Bbl, up 0.28% from the previous day. Over the past month, Brent's price has risen 9.33%, but it is still 9.50% lower than a year ago. The EIA forecasts the Brent crude oil price will average $56 per barrel in 2026, 19% less than in 2025. Fitch Ratings forecasts Brent at $65/bbl for 2026.
*   **Pulp:** On February 4, 2026, Kraft Pulp rose to 5272 CNY/T, up 0.27% from the previous day. Over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 3.51%, and is down 14.42% compared to the same time last year. On January 28, 2026, Brazil's Suzano announced it would hike pulp prices by up to $30 per ton in February.
*   **CBIOs:** There is no specific data on CBIO (Certificados de Descarbonização) prices in the search results.

**2. Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   The search results do not provide specific data on the direct impact of the Selic rate and IPCA (Índice Nacional de Preços ao Consumidor Amplo) on sector funding and demand. However, it is generally understood that a higher Selic rate can increase borrowing costs for companies in the sector, potentially impacting investments and expansion. IPCA, as a measure of inflation, can affect input costs and consumer demand for paper products.

**3. Regulatory Actions:**

*   **Central Bank of Brazil (BCB):** On January 30, 2026, BCB Instruction No. 701/2026 was issued, complementing BCB Resolution No. 520/2025, establishing requirements for independent technical certification for virtual asset intermediation and custody services. On April 24, 2025, the BCB announced its regulatory priorities for 2025 and 2026, including the evolution of Open Finance, virtual asset regulations, monitoring artificial intelligence usage, and the expansion of Pix's functionalities.
*   **Tax Reform:** On January 14, 2026, Complementary Law 227/2026 was published, containing additional regulation of the Tax Reform on Consumption.
*   **Digital Markets:** Bill No. 4,675/2025 is currently being debated, introducing a designation mechanism for economic agents with systemic relevance in digital markets.
*   **Financial Regulation:** More extensive capital reforms are expected in 2026, with a revised rule to implement the Basel III reforms by early 2026.

**4. Global Correlation:**

*   **China:** China's stimulus measures are expected to boost iron ore demand. However, the expansion of China's integrated pulp and paper production is likely to reduce imports in the coming years.
*   **US Fed Rates:** When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, US assets become more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real.
*   **US Tariffs:** In July 2025, the US imposed a 50% tariff on all imports from Brazil.
