Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Hedge Fund sector in Brazil, focusing on external drivers, without mentioning specific companies.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers impacting the Hedge Fund sector in Brazil, as of February 4, 2026:

**1. Commodity/Input Prices:**

**2. Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **Selic Rate:** The Central Bank of Brazil (Copom) maintained the Selic rate at 15.00%. However, Copom signaled it will begin an interest rate easing cycle in March 2026.
*   **IPCA (Inflation):** IPCA readings in Q4 2025 surprised on the downside, with subdued core inflation. Inflation ended 2025 within the tolerance band of the inflation target.

**3. Regulatory Actions:**

*   **Tax Reform:** Complementary Law 227/2026 was published on January 14, 2026, containing additional regulations for the Tax Reform on Consumption. This law sets forth rules on the administration and enforcement of the Goods and Services Tax (IBS) and the Contribution on Goods and Services (CBS), as well as the Inheritance and Donation Tax (ITCMD) and the Excise Tax (IS).
*   **Concessions and PPPs:** The Brazilian senate is debating a bill to update the law on concessions and public-private partnerships.

**4. Global Correlation:**

*   **China:** China's stimulus measures and increased policy bank lending are offsetting weak domestic demand. Chinese companies invested $2.2 billion in Brazil in the first six months of 2025, a 5% increase compared to the same period a year earlier.
*   **US Fed Rates:** The US Federal Reserve maintained its benchmark interest rates at a range of 3.50% to 3.75% per year. The nomination of Kevin Warsh to succeed Jerome Powell as Chair of the Federal Reserve strengthened the dollar globally. US labor market indicators reinforcing employment stability are expected to support Treasury yields and strengthen the dollar globally.
*   **US Tariffs:** The US administration imposed tariffs on Brazil, which led Brazil to denounce Washington before the World Trade Organization.
