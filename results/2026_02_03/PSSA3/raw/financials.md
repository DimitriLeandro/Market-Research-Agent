Okay, I understand. I will act as a Financial Auditor and Forensic Accountant and extract the requested financial data for PSSA3 from its most recent Quarterly Results (Earnings Release) and Management Guidance. I will focus on finding the specific numbers for the last reported quarter vs. the same quarter last year (YoY) for the specified metrics, calculate the percentage change where possible, and provide context for the changes. The output will be a raw data log.
