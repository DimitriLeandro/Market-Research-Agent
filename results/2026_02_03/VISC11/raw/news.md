Based on the search results, here's a log of material events for VISC11 (Vinci Shopping Centers FII) from the last 90 days:

**No material events detected in the search window.**

While I found information about VISC11, including dividend information, performance data, and links to "Fatos Relevantes" and other market communications, I didn't find any specific *material* events (M&A, CEO changes, lawsuits, analyst ratings changes, operational disruptions) within the last 90 days (approximately from November 6, 2025, to February 4, 2026) that meet the criteria. I checked for official filings, news reports on legal issues, sell-side activity, and operational problems, but the search did not return any relevant results within that timeframe.
