## RZAK11 (Riza Akin FII) - Investment Thesis

### Bull Case (Upside)

1.  **Competitive Moat:** RZAK11 is a "fundo de papel" investing primarily in real estate debt securities (CRIs). Its competitive advantage stems from its active management strategy, focusing on diversification across various credit segments and securitization, aiming for an optimal risk-return-liquidity profile. The fund diversifies across six segments: fixed income, direct lending, securitization and portfolios, agribusiness, infrastructure, and real estate. Riza Akin FII distinguishes itself through active management, exploring aspects like diversification, guarantees and indexers. RZAK11 does not have exposure to multi-ownership properties, which is common in higher-yielding funds.
2.  **Growth CapEx:** No verifiable data found for specific growth CapEx projects.
3.  **Debt & Solvency:** No verifiable data found for Net Debt/EBITDA ratio or debt maturity profile.
4.  **Ownership & Governance:** The fund is managed by Riza Asset Management and administered by BTG Pactual. The fund is intended for general investors, including non-residents of Brazil. No verifiable data found regarding specific insider buying/selling or poison pills/shareholder agreements.

### Bear Case (Downside)

1.  **Competitive Moat:** The fund's management fee is 1.25% per annum, which is relatively high.
2.  **Growth CapEx:** No verifiable data found for specific growth CapEx projects.
3.  **Debt & Solvency:** No verifiable data found for Net Debt/EBITDA ratio or debt maturity profile.
4.  **Ownership & Governance:** No verifiable data found regarding specific insider buying/selling or poison pills/shareholder agreements.
5.  **Risks:** The fund's returns can fluctuate significantly month-to-month. The fund has exposure to assets under judicial recovery, such as Starbucks. Part of the high dividend yield comes from one-off events that may not be repeated in the coming months. In December 2023, it was confirmed that the judicial recovery request was granted to SOUTHROCK CAPITAL LTDA, the debtor of CRIs from Starbucks III, IV and V. The CRIs belonging to the fund's portfolio are not subject to the judicial recovery process. The administrator marked PDD on these assets for an amount equivalent to 65% of the face value in December 2023.
