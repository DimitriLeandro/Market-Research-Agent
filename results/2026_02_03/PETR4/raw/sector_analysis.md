Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Oil & Gas sector in Brazil, focusing on external drivers and adhering to the specified format and constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Oil & Gas sector in Brazil, based on the provided research:

*   **Commodity/Input Prices:**
    *   **Brent Crude Oil:** The current price of Brent Oil futures is $67.48. The 52-week price range for Brent Oil futures spans from $58.40 to $81.40. Over the past year, the price of Brent Oil futures has changed by -11.27%.
    *   **Iron Ore:** The iron ore price is $102.16.
*   **Interest Rates & Inflation:**
    *   **Selic Rate:** The benchmark interest rate in Brazil is 15%. The market is pricing the Selic rate at 12.5% by 2026, but Brazil will continue with a real interest rate above 8% per year. High interest rates increase difficulties in maintaining investments. In July 2025, the average rate of credit to companies jumped from 20.58% to 25.02% per year.
    *   **IPCA:** The National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) ended 2023 with an accumulated variation of 4.62%, down from 5.79% in 2022. From July 2023 to June 2024, as measured by the IPCA, inflation accumulated 3.93% over 12 months. Brazil's headline inflation decelerated to an annual 4.26% in December.
*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   **Law No. 14,993/2024:** Created the National Program for Decarbonization of Natural Gas Producers and Importers and Biomethane Incentives, which aims to encourage research, production, commercialization, and use of biomethane and biogas in the Brazilian energy matrix. This obligation will come into force on January 1, 2026, with an initial value of 1% and cannot exceed a 10% reduction in emissions.
    *   **Law No. 15.269/2025:** Consolidated a package of regulatory changes for the Brazilian electricity sector starting in 2026.
    *   **Future Fuels Law:** Enacted to provide incentives for the production and use of advanced biofuels, including biogas, biomethane, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), green diesel, and second-generation ethanol.
    *   **New Gas Law (Law No. 14,134/2021):** Intends to foster competition in the sector. Decree No. 12,153/2024 regulates various aspects of the New Gas Law.
    *   **ANP Resolution 52/2015:** Requires prior ANP authorization for the construction, expansion, and operation of oil and gas pipelines.
    *   **Mixing Mandates:** From March 2025, the percentage of mixing biodiesel with diesel oil will be 15%, increasing annually until 2030 when the percentage is 20%.
*   **Global Correlation:**
    *   **China:** China, the world's biggest oil importer, has already reached a plateau in demand for oil-based fuels.
    *   **US Tariffs:** Companies also face the increase in US tariffs on Brazilian exports.
    *   **US Economic Conditions and Global Financial Volatility:** External factors such as US economic conditions and global financial volatility continue to affect emerging markets.
    *   **IEA Scenarios:** A significant share of new Brazilian oil production is at risk of becoming stranded: 22% if governments meet their announced climate pledges or 56% if demand declines in line with a 1.5°C global warming limit.
*   **Production and Market Growth:**
    *   The Brazil Oil And Gas Market is expected to grow from USD 22.76 billion in 2025 to USD 23.67 billion in 2026 and is forecast to reach USD 28.82 billion by 2031 at 4.01% CAGR over 2026-2031.
    *   Brazil is set to expand oil and gas production by more than 20% by 2030.
    *   The 2023 average oil production was 3.4 million barrels per day, 12.57% higher than the previous annual record in 2022.
    *   Brazil's 2024-2034 Energy Expansion Plan forecasts that the country's oil production will reach 4.4 million barrels of oil per day by 2034.
*   **Industrial Output:**
    *   Brazil's industrial output fell by 1.2% in December from a month prior, marking the steepest decline since July 2024, according to national statistics agency IBGE.
    *   Brazil's 2025 industrial output reached a third increase in a row at 0.6% above a year earlier and pre-pandemic levels, following a 3.1% rise in 2024.
    *   Output of petroleum coke, oil products and biofuels increased by 5.4% in December from the previous month.
