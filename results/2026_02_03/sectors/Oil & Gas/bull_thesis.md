Okay, I will construct a bull case for the Oil & Gas sector in Brazil, focusing on positive drivers and using hard data where available.

Here's a bull case for the Oil & Gas sector in Brazil, based on the research objectives:

### Bull Case: Brazil Oil & Gas Sector

**1. Growth Drivers (Expanding Total Addressable Market)**

*   **Increased Production:** Brazil's oil and gas production is expected to grow in 2025, driven by pre-salt reserves. Average daily production of oil and natural gas combined climbed to 4.897 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2025, a nearly 13% increase compared to the previous record in 2023. Output also rose by more than 13% year-on-year from 2024, confirming a sustained growth trend.
*   **Pre-Salt Dominance:** The pre-salt is responsible for 79.63% of all oil and gas production nationally throughout 2025. Volumes extracted from the country's offshore pre-salt in 2025 were on the order of 3.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboe/d), an increase of 15% compared with 2024, representing 80% of national production (4.9Mboe/d).
*   **Offshore Focus:** Investments are heavily focused on offshore production in the Campos and Santos Basins, which will receive nearly 90% of total investment.
*   **Investment Surge:** Brazil's oil and gas industry is set for a major boost, with investments projected to surpass R$ 609 billion ($122 billion) between 2025 and 2029, according to data from the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas, and Biofuels (ANP). In 2025 alone, investments are expected to reach R$ 139.5 billion, with the Campos and Santos Basins accounting for an overwhelming 95.85% of this amount.
*   **FPSO Vessels:** Brazil's offshore liquids production is forecast to grow by 21% to reach 4.5 million BLPD, as 18 floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) vessels are expected to go onstream between 2026 and 2032.
*   **Natural Gas Expansion:** Brazil's natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) market is expanding because of rising domestic consumption, infrastructure development, and market reforms. Petrobras plans to invest $111bn between 2025 and 2029 across all its activities, with $77.3bn allocated for Exploration & Production (mainly oil and gas).
*   **Proven Gas Reserves:** Brazil's proven gas reserves stood at around 546bn cubic metres (about 19.3 Tcf) at the end of 2024, with an estimated value of $38bn to $104bn depending on market prices applied.
*   **Increased Gas Production:** Brazil is currently producing 153mn cubic metres of gas per day in 2024, with monthly peaks reaching up to 172mn m³/day in 2025.

**2. Macro Tailwinds (Interest Rates, Inflation, Exchange Rates)**

*   **Steady Economic Growth:** Brazil's economy has been growing steadily, with GDP rising by 2.9% in the first quarter of 2025 and 2.2% in the second quarter.
*   **Global Growth Forecast:** Global growth is projected to remain resilient at 3.3 percent in 2026.
*   **Inflation Expectations:** Inflation expectations stand at 4.0% for 2026 and 3.8% for 2027, and Copom projects inflation at 3.2% by the third quarter of 2027.
*   **Managed Interest Rates:** Brazil's central bank maintained its benchmark rate at 15.00% in January, saying a prolonged hold is needed to keep inflation on a steady path toward the target amid elevated uncertainty. Interest Rate in Brazil is expected to be 14.50 percent by the end of this quarter.

**3. Commodity/Input Prices (Input Costs Falling or Output Prices Rising)**

*   **Gasoline Price Increase:** Gasoline (Mid), ret, BR price was approximately 6,280 BRL per m3 in May 2025, a 7.6% increase year-over-year. Gasoline (Premium), whl, BR price reached about 4,450 BRL per m3 in May 2025, a 5.6% increase year-over-year.
*   **Crude Oil Increase:** The energy price index surged by 12% in January 2026, driven by a 4.6% increase in crude oil.

**4. Regulatory Support (Government Incentives, Subsidies, or Favorable Concessions)**

*   **Fossil Fuel Subsidies:** Brazil's spending on fossil fuels subsidies in 2023 was around 4.5 times larger than its spending on renewables subsidies. The country spent R$99.8bn ($17.49bn) in subsidies for both fossil fuels and renewables in 2023. Of the total, R$81.74bn was related to fossil fuels.
*   **Repetro:** Special taxation regimes to the oil and gas sector, the largest of which is known as Repetro.
*   **New Gas Law:** The New Gas Law, approved in 2020, aims to make the market more competitive, promote third-party access to infrastructure, and attract private investment in the sector.
*   **Future Fuels Law:** The Future Fuels Law (Law No. 14,993/2024) provides incentives for the production and use of advanced biofuels, including biogas, biomethane, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), green diesel, as well as carbon capture and storage (CCS) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).
*   **Low-Emission Hydrogen Legal Framework:** The Low-Emission Hydrogen Legal Framework (Law No. 14,599/2024) establishes regulatory guidelines for the production, storage, and commercialisation of low-carbon hydrogen.

**In Summary:**

The Brazilian Oil & Gas sector presents a compelling bull case due to increasing production, substantial investments in offshore activities, a growing natural gas market, supportive regulatory policies, and rising output prices. The pre-salt reserves remain a key driver, and the focus on infrastructure development further strengthens the sector's growth potential. While interest rates are relatively high, inflation expectations are moderating, and the government continues to provide significant subsidies to the fossil fuel industry.
