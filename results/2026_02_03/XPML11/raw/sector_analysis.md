Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Shopping Malls sector in Brazil, focusing on the specified drivers and adhering to the output requirements.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers impacting the Shopping Malls sector in Brazil, based on the latest available information:

*   **Iron Ore Prices:** On February 4, 2026, Iron Ore traded flat at $102.16 USD/T. Over the past month, the price has fallen 3.74%, and it is down 2.53% compared to the same time last year. The Brazilian 65% Fe iron ore price is $117/mt, CFR China, a slight decline from $118/mt one week prior. In the Brazilian domestic market, reference prices are $95/mt for the ore and $113/mt for pellets.
*   **Brent Oil Prices:** I do not have enough information to determine the current Brent Oil prices in Brazil.
*   **Pulp Prices:** I do not have enough information to determine the current pulp prices in Brazil.
*   **CBIO Prices:** The average CBIO price was R$59.30 ($10.70) on May 13, 2025, its lowest since September 2022. On June 12, 2025, the price recovered slightly, reaching R$59.50. On February 3, 2026, CBIOs last traded at R$ 29,60.
*   **Selic Rate & Inflation:** On February 3, 2026, Brazil's central bank signaled it will begin cutting interest rates in March but stressed borrowing costs must remain restrictive. The bank kept the benchmark Selic rate at 15% for the fifth consecutive time. Improving current inflation and market expectations "less distant" from the 3% target offered clearer evidence that monetary policy is transmitting as expected.
*   **ANEEL Regulatory Actions:** On January 29, 2026, ANEEL authorized the 2025 Electric Power Transmission Subsidies Plan (POTEE 2025), representing total investments of approximately BRL 1 billion in new transmission facilities over the next four years. Regulatory Order No. 200/2026 formalizes the decision. On January 27, 2026, ANEEL approved a new rule that increases the weight of consumer satisfaction in the calculation of electricity tariffs, which will take effect on January 1, 2027.
*   **ANP Regulatory Actions:** I did not find any information about ANP regulatory actions.
*   **ANS Regulatory Actions:** On January 6, 2025, ANS opened Public Consultation No. 147/25 to receive contributions on normative proposals that change the procedures adopted by the ANS for structuring and executing its oversight actions.
*   **Central Bank Regulatory Actions:** Central banks and regulators are using instant payment schemes to promote competition and financial inclusion.
*   **New Legislation (Taxes):** On January 14, 2026, Complementary Law 227 was published, containing the additional regulation of the Tax Reform on Consumption. In December 2024, the National Congress approved the basic text of the Complementary Bill (PLP 68/24) that regulates Constitutional Amendment 132/23 (“Tax Reform”) and institutes the Tax on Goods and Services (IBS). In sales of real estate, the rates will be reduced by 50% (relative to the standard rates), except for transactions related to liens, which will be immune.
*   **New Legislation (Concessions):** I did not find any information about new legislation regarding concessions.
*   **China Stimulus Impact:** Increased iron ore inventories in 35 ports in China have reached a total of 153 million mt, 2.77 million mt more in just one week. Uncertainties regarding the future demand for the ore are also playing a negative role in prices.
*   **US Fed Rates Impact:** When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, US assets become more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real. This depreciation increases the cost of importing inputs and raises financing costs for Brazilian companies, reducing their investment capacity.
*   **Vacancy Rates:** Vacancy rates have followed a consistent downward trend across all asset classes since the end of the pandemic, now surpassing even pre-crisis levels. In the high-end segment, vacancy stood at 11.8% at the end of 2017, peaked at 19.6% in the second quarter of 2020, and reached 7.15% in the third quarter of 2025.
*   **Consumer Behavior:** Shopping malls in Brazil are facing changing consumption patterns, with Brazilian consumers becoming increasingly digital. From 2020 to 2024, the number of service operations within shopping malls grew by 42%, and the convenience sector already represents more than 10% of the stores.
*   **Real Estate Funds:** In 2025, real estate investment trusts (REITs) focused on shopping malls appreciated by 18.4%, surpassing the average index of funds in the sector, according to data from B3 (the Brazilian stock exchange).
*   **Holiday Commerce:** A decree altering rules for business operations on holidays and union strengthening are impacting the sector.
*   **Tax-Free Shopping:** Rolling out from 2025, a tax exemption is intended to apply to purchases made by foreign travelers in Rio de Janeiro using a bank card that has not been issued from within the Brazilian banking system.
