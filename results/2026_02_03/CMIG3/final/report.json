  "summary": "Cemig (CMIG3) presents a mixed picture. While the company benefits from its integrated operations and the inherent barriers to entry in the Brazilian electricity sector, recent financial results show a decline in adjusted EBITDA and net income. A substantial investment plan for 2026-2030 signals growth ambitions, but government ownership and regulatory risks remain key concerns. Recent news highlights both positive developments, such as the acquisition of solar power plants, and potential risks, such as UBS reducing its stake in derivative instruments linked to CMIG4 shares. The stock currently trades with a dividend yield of 10.94%.",
  "bullish_thesis": "Cemig operates within the Brazilian electricity sector, which possesses natural barriers to entry due to the significant capital expenditure required for power generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure. As an integrated utility with operations spanning generation, transmission, and distribution, Cemig benefits from diversification and potential operational synergies. The company is actively investing in its transmission infrastructure to reinforce the grid and connect new renewable generation sources. Cemig has announced a substantial R$44 billion investment plan for 2026-2030, signaling a commitment to future growth. The company also distributes up to 50% of its net profit to shareholders as mandatory dividends.",
  "bearish_thesis": "The Brazilian electricity sector is subject to regulatory risks, which could impact Cemig's profitability. Government ownership could lead to political interference in Cemig's operations. Recent financial results indicate a decline in profitability, with Q3 2025 adjusted EBITDA falling by 16.3% year-on-year. While the company has a significant investment plan, delays in project execution or cost overruns could negatively impact returns. High interest rates and external trade pressures in Brazil could also restrict production levels and hamper export activities.",
  "financial_analysis": "Cemig's net revenue for Q3 2025 was R$10.62 billion, a 4.6% increase year-on-year, driven by growth in electricity supply revenue (up 6.1%) and TUSD distribution charges (up 8.5%). However, adjusted EBITDA for the same period declined by 16.3%. Net income for Q3 2025 was R$796.7 million, down from R$3.28 billion in the prior year. Full-year 2025 revenue was $6.5 billion and net income was $4.1 billion. Cemig expects to reach R$ 6.3 billion in investment in 2025, an 18% increase from 2024. The company has announced a R$44 billion investment plan for 2026-2030. The company distributes up to 50% of net profit to shareholders in the form of mandatory dividends. Morningstar data shows a normalized Price/Earnings of 10.03 and Price/Sales of 0.99.",
