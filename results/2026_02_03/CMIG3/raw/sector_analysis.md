Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Utilities/Energy sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Utilities/Energy sector in Brazil:

*   **Commodity/Input Prices:**
    *   **Iron Ore:** On February 4, 2026, Iron Ore spot price was $102.17 USD/T, a 0.01% increase from the previous day. Over the past month, the price has decreased by 3.73%, and it is down 2.52% compared to the same time last year. Overall consensus forecast for 2026 is $94 USD/T.
    *   **Brent Oil:** On February 4, 2026, Brent Crude oil price was $68.66 USD/Bbl, up 1.98% from the previous day. Over the past month, Brent's price has risen 11.18%, but it is still 7.97% lower than a year ago. The EIA forecasts Brent Crude to average $56 per barrel in 2026.
    *   **CBIOs (Decarbonization Credits):** For 2026, the overall target has been set at 48.09 million CBIOs, equivalent to a reduction of 48.09 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. In July 2022, the average CBIO price was 196 reais.

*   **Interest Rates & Inflation:**
    *   **Selic Rate:** In December 2025, Brazil's central bank held the Selic rate steady at 9.5%. In February 2026, the bank's board kept the Selic rate at 15%.
    *   **Inflation:** Electricity rates are expected to rise by an average of 5.4% in 2026, driven by transmission costs. Electricity was the item that weighed most heavily on Brazilian inflation in 2025, with residential electricity bills accumulating a 12.31% increase.
    *   **Impact of Interest Rates and Inflation:** High interest rates and external trade pressures have restricted production levels and hampered export activities for the Brazilian industrial sector.

*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   **Law No. 15.269:** In November 2025, Law No. 15.269 was approved, redefining the energy sector in Brazil, updating rules, expanding social protection, modernizing electricity planning, and adjusting tariffs to guarantee stability and predictability for the consumer.
    *   **ANEEL Tariff Flags:** In January 2026, ANEEL activated the green tariff flag, indicating no additional cost on electricity bills.
    *   **MME Reserve Auction Rules:** In December 2025, the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) changed the rules for the 2026 reserve auction, impacting thermal and hydroelectric plants. The changes affect mainly thermal power plants using gas, coal, oil, and biodiesel, as well as hydroelectric plants seeking to expand capacity.
    *   **RenovaBio Targets:** In December 2025, Brazil's National Council for Energy Policy (CNPE) published a resolution fixing annual mandatory targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions from fuel sales for the period between 2026 and 2035. For 2026, the overall target has been set at 48.09 million CBIOs.
    *   **ICMS Increase:** State-level VAT ICMS was increased on January 1, 2026, for gasoline, anhydrous ethanol, diesel, and biodiesel. For diesel, the tax was raised 4.5% to Real 1.17/liter.

*   **Global Correlation:**
    *   **China:** Brazil's energy sector is attracting substantial Chinese investment, with approximately 70% of Chinese FDI concentrated in sustainability and green energy. Access to Chinese renewable technology at competitive prices accelerates Brazil's low-carbon transition without abandoning economically valuable oil production. Weakened Chinese demand will reduce appetite for Brazilian commodity exports, particularly iron ore.
    *   **US Fed Rates:** The US policy mix—expansive fiscal policy, trade restrictions, and Federal Reserve pressure—creates risks that the supportive backdrop for emerging market economies like Brazil may not continue.
    *   **Chinese subsidies:** Starting April 1, 2026, China will eliminate VAT refunds for photovoltaic modules, which is expected to increase prices in Brazil. For batteries, the subsidy will be reduced from 9% to 6% between April and December 2026, and then completely cancelled from January 1, 2027.
    *   **US Tariffs:** US tariffs and high interest rates are dampening Brazil's growth. Exports to the United States dropped by 8.6 percent in the second half of 2025.
