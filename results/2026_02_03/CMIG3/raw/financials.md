I will act as a Financial Auditor and Forensic Accountant and extract the requested financial data for CMIG3 from its most recent Quarterly Results (Earnings Release) and Management Guidance, focusing on YoY comparisons and providing context for changes. I will then present the findings in a raw data log format.
Okay, I have gathered some information on CMIG3. Here's the financial data log based on the search results. I will continue to refine this as I find more specific data.
