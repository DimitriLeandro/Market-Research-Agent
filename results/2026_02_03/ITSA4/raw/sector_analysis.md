Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Financials/Holding sector in Brazil, focusing on external drivers and adhering to the specified format and constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Brazilian Financials/Holding sector:

    *   In 2023, Chemical Wood Pulp exports decreased to $7.2B.

*   **CBIO Prices:**
    *   Average CBIO trading prices were at their lowest levels since 2022 as of June 16, 2025, mainly reflecting insecurity caused by sector defaults and oversupply from suppressed demand.
    *   The average CBIO price was R$59.30 ($10.70) on May 13, 2025, its lowest since September 2022.
    *   As of June 12, 2025, the CBIO price had recovered slightly to R$59.50.

*   **Interest Rates (Selic) and Inflation (IPCA):**
    *   On February 3, 2026, Brazil's central bank signaled it would begin cutting interest rates in March, but stressed borrowing costs must remain restrictive.
    *   The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) kept the Selic rate at 15% for the fifth consecutive time as of February 3, 2026.
    *   The BCB minutes indicated improving current inflation and market expectations "less distant" from the 3% target.
    *   Economists surveyed by the central bank projected inflation at 3.99% for 2026.
    *   In 2024, bank credit grew by 11.5% and corporate bond issuance rose by 30% despite the high Selic rate.
    *   The Central Bank of Brazil kept the Selic rate unchanged for the sixth consecutive meeting as of February 2, 2026, while the Federal Reserve ended a cycle of three cuts.
    *   In 2024, inflation reached 4.83%.
    *   The Copom maintained the Selic rate at 15.00%, but consolidated the view that the easing cycle will begin in 2026.

*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   In December 2024, Brazil passed the law creating a regulated carbon market.

*   **Global Correlation:**
    *   As of February 2, 2026, USDBRL should reflect US Payroll, Copom minutes, US government shutdown, geopolitical fears, and ECB decision.
    *   If US labor market indicators reinforce employment stability, the expectation that US interest rates will remain high for a prolonged period tends to consolidate, supporting Treasury yields and strengthening the dollar globally.
    *   The intensification of tensions involving the US and Iran increases global risk aversion, favoring "safe-haven" assets and potentially hurting emerging market currencies, such as the real.
    *   A signal to start the easing cycle in March in the Copom minutes tends to reduce the outlook for the Brazilian interest rate differential and weigh on the real.
    *   The possibility of a shutdown of public services in the US could intensify aversion to the dollar and stimulate portfolio diversification toward emerging markets, benefiting the real.
    *   Maintaining the benchmark rate in the Eurozone tends to support the appreciation of the euro against the dollar, a movement that could weaken the dollar globally and indirectly favor the real.
    *   The Brazilian stock market experienced a downturn on Tuesday, October 8, 2024, as investors reacted to China's new stimulus package, which disappointed market expectations.
    *   Chinese investments in Brazil totaled US$4.18 billion in 2024, a 113% increase compared with 2023.
    *   The electric power sector led in attracting Chinese capital, accounting for 34% of operations, with inflows of US$1.43 billion, 115% higher than in 2023.
    *   When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, US assets become more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real.
