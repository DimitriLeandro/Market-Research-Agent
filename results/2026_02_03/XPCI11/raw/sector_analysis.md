Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Brazilian Paper/Receivables sector, focusing on the external environment and adhering to the specified constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Brazilian Paper/Receivables sector:

**1. Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Iron Ore:** On February 4, 2026, Iron Ore traded at $102.16 USD/T. Over the past month, the price has fallen 3.74%, and is down 2.53% compared to the same time last year. Vale forecasts iron ore prices to stabilize around $100/t in 2026. Increased supply from large mining companies and a gradual decline in demand from China are expected.
*   **Brent Oil:** On February 4, 2026, Brent Crude rose to $67.52 USD/Bbl. Over the past month, Brent's price has risen 9.33%, but it is still 9.50% lower than a year ago. The EIA projects Brent crude to average $55.08 per barrel in 2026.
*   **Pulp (Kraft):** On February 4, 2026, Kraft Pulp rose to 5272 CNY/T. Over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 3.51%, and is down 14.42% compared to the same time last year. In Q1 2026, pulp prices in Latin America plummeted by 18%.
*   **CBIOs:** Insufficient information was found to provide the current price and trend.

**2. Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **Selic Rate:** In July 2025, the Copom maintained the Selic rate at 15.00% p.a.. BofA forecasts the Selic rate at 11.25% at the end of the rate cut cycle in 2026.
*   **IPCA:** The financial market's forecast for IPCA in 2026 has increased to 4.28%. Inflation expectations for 2025 and 2026 collected by the Focus survey remained above the inflation target and stand at 5.1% and 4.4%, respectively.

**3. Regulatory Actions:**

*   **Tax Reform:** Complementary Law 227/2026, published on January 14, 2026, contains additional regulations for the Tax Reform on Consumption, including rules for the Goods and Services Tax (IBS) and the Contribution on Goods and Services (CBS). From 2027 to 2033, financial services will be taxed at increasing IBS and CBS rates, from 10.85% to 12.5%, with automatic reduction where ISS also applies.
*   **Central Bank:** The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) announced its regulatory priorities for 2025 and 2026, including the evolution of Open Finance, virtual asset regulations, monitoring artificial intelligence usage, and the expansion of Pix's functionalities.
*   **ANEEL:** ANEEL established 91 activities for its regulatory agenda for the 2026–2027 biennium, addressing topics such as curtailment, energy storage, extreme climate events, and market opening. In 2026, ANEEL will play a central role in regulating Law No. 15.269, which promoted a significant reform in the legal framework of the electricity sector.
*   **Drawback and RECOF Regimes:** Complementary Law No. 216/2025 includes services in the Drawback and RECOF customs regimes, effective from January 1, 2026, for RECOF changes.

**4. Global Correlation:**

*   **China:** China's stimulus measures are expected to boost iron ore demand. However, the expansion of China's integrated pulp and paper production is likely to reduce imports of Brazilian pulp.
*   **US Fed Rates:** The US Fed's monetary policy and economic outlook create uncertainty in the global environment. J.P. Morgan expects Brent to reach $58/bbl in 2026, despite recent trade policy developments.
*   **US Tariffs:** The Committee has been closely monitoring the announcements on tariffs by the USA to Brazil, which reinforces its cautious stance in a scenario of heightened uncertainty.
