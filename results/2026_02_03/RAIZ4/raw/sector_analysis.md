Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Energy/Sugar & Ethanol sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Energy/Sugar & Ethanol sector in Brazil, as of February 4, 2026:

**Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Iron Ore:** The Iron Ore 62% futures price is $102.17. Over the past year, the price has decreased by 2.52%.
*   **Brent Crude Oil:** The price of Brent Crude oil is $68.66 per barrel, a 1.98% increase from the previous day. However, it is 7.97% lower than a year ago. Another source states the price of Brent Crude oil is $67.60 per barrel, up 2.27% from the previous trading day.
*   **CBIOs (Decarbonization Credits):** On January 16, 2026, the last trade for CBIOs was R$ 29.60. In October 2024, CBIO prices rose by 17% over two weeks, reaching R$91 ($16), the highest level since May 2024.

**Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   The search results did not provide specific information on the direct impact of the Selic rate and IPCA on the sector.

**Regulatory Actions:**

*   **Law 15.082/2024:** Enacted on December 31, 2024, guarantees sugarcane producers a share of revenues from trading Decarbonization Credits (CBIOs). It amends the National Biofuels Policy (RenovaBio) to include independent sugarcane producers. The law also revises Law 9.478/1997 to strengthen sector regulations, including increased fines for unmet decarbonization targets, now classified as environmental crimes.
*   **Ethanol and Biodiesel Blend Mandates:** As of August 1, 2025, the share of ethanol mixed with gasoline increased from 27% to 30%, and the amount of biodiesel in diesel fuel increased from 14% to 15%.
*   **New Subcommittee for Biofuel Blends:** On October 29, 2025, Brazil's Ministry of Mines and Energy approved a new subcommittee to coordinate studies and propose measures aimed at enabling higher blends of biodiesel and ethanol, potentially up to 35% for ethanol and 20% for biodiesel.
*   **Taxation:** Brazil's National Congress approved a selective tax on tobacco, soft drinks, and alcohol as part of a fiscal reform.

**Global Correlation:**

*   **China's E10 Gasoline Policy:** China and Brazil reached an ethanol cooperation agreement in May 2025, aimed at expanding Brazil's ethanol exports to China as China prepares to implement its E10 gasoline policy, mandating a 10% blend of ethanol in gasoline. In May 2025, China and Brazil resolved a Brazilian complaint to the World Trade Organization (WTO) about Chinese tariffs on sugar, paving the way for greater imports.
*   **US Tariffs:** A 50% tariff imposed by the U.S. administration has practically paralyzed one of the most profitable markets for sugar from Northeast Brazil.
*   **US Biofuel Policy:** The U.S. government is considering expanding mandates for domestically produced biofuels, which could limit imports.
*   **Global Sugar Surplus:** The International Sugar Organization (ISO) on November 17, forecast a 1.625 million MT sugar surplus in 2025-26. Green Pool Commodity Specialists said they expect a 2.74 MMT global sugar surplus for 2025/26 and a 156,000 MT surplus for 2026/27. StoneX said it expects a global sugar surplus of 2.9 MMT in 2025/26.
*   **Increased Sugar Production in India:** The India Sugar Mill Association (ISMA) reported that India's 2025-26 sugar output from October 1-January 15 is up +22% y/y to 15.9 MMT.
*   **Corn Ethanol Competition:** Booming corn ethanol production is pushing sugar-cane processors away from the biofuel market, prompting them to divert a record share of their crop to making sweetener.
