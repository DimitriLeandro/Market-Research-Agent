Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Brazilian agriculture sector, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's an analysis of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Brazilian agriculture sector:

*   **Commodity/Input Prices:**
    *   **Soybeans:** In January 2026, StoneX reported that soybeans maintain a comfortable global balance, with a new production record in Brazil estimated at 177.6 million tons. However, a record soybean year could put downward pressure on local prices, further complicating margins.
    *   **Corn:** Oversupply in the U.S. is putting pressure on corn prices.
    *   **Fertilizers:** Supply constraints are keeping fertilizer prices high.
    *   **Freight Rates:** Truck freight costs in Brazil climbed as much as 20% in January 2026, as the soy harvest accelerates in Mato Grosso. Nationwide, tariffs are expected to average about 8% higher in 2026.

*   **Interest Rates & Inflation:**
    *   **Selic Rate:** In the second half of 2025, Brazil's central bank maintained the Selic rate at 15%. The 2025/2026 Harvest Plan increased interest rates 1.5% to 2% compared to the prior year, ranging from 8.5% to 14%. As of February 4, 2026, the Selic rate remained at 15.00%.
    *   **IPCA Inflation:** Brazilian economists predict a 2026 inflation rate of 3.99%. In December 2025, the annual inflation rate was 4.26%.
    *   **Impact:** High interest rates are making rural credit more expensive, limiting investment, expansion, and modernization of production.

*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   **Tax Reform:** Tax reform comes into effect from January 2026, with new rules that will change how registration, tax issuance, and taxation are handled in the field.
    *   **Soy Moratorium:** In January 2026, major soy traders announced they would abandon the soy moratorium agreement, under which companies voluntarily agreed to ban soy grown in areas deforested after 2008.
    *   **Mato Grosso Law:** A new law in Mato Grosso state, effective January 1, 2026, allows the state government to suspend tax breaks to companies adopting environmental criteria beyond those required by Brazilian law, such as the soy moratorium.
    *   **EU Regulation on Deforestation-free Products (EUDR):** From the end of 2026, companies importing soy-based products into the European Union will have to comply with the EUDR, which will ban products originating in areas deforested after 2020.
    *   **Pesticide Regulations:** The Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply (MAPA) is revising pesticide management regulations.

*   **Global Correlation:**
    *   **China:** Chinese investment is boosting Brazilian agricultural growth, particularly in railways and ports. China's state-owned agriculture company COFCO is investing about US$285 million on a grain terminal at the Port of Santos.
    *   **US:** Sales of U.S. soybeans to China are expected to partly reduce demand for Brazilian soybeans in 2026. The U.S. is projected to produce 115.751 million metric tons of soybeans in the 2025/2026 harvest.
    *   **US Fed Rates:** The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate to a range of 4.00% to 4.25% per year.
    *   **Trade relations:** U.S. soybean exports to China have struggled to rebound fully since 2020, and with Brazil's advantage in both cost and logistics, that rebound remains in doubt.
    *   **Soybean Exports:** Brazilian soybean traders are expected to ship 77 million metric tons of the oilseed to China in 2026, ten million tons less than in 2025. Overall, Brazilian soy shipments are projected to reach a record 112 million tons in 2026.
    *   **Poultry:** Brazil's poultry sector is expected to maintain strong production levels in 2026, supported by favorable prices and a recovery in export demand.
