**Context/Reasons for Changes:**

*   **Revenue Decline:** The decrease in net revenue was attributed to seasonality and lower sugarcane sales. Lower sugarcane productivity and sugar content, due to adverse weather and ice events, negatively impacted results and costs.
*   **Net Loss:** The company posted a net loss, mainly due to non-cash effects from mark-to-market on receivables and assets.
*   **EBITDA Margin Decline:** Adjusted EBITDA margin fell due to the aforementioned factors affecting revenue and profitability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Operational diversification (soy, corn, cotton, cattle) helped offset some sector volatility.
*   The company secured favorable fertilizer and input costs, aiding contribution margins despite commodity volatility.
*   Q1 is typically a low-revenue quarter due to the timing of harvests and plantings.
*   A dividend of R$75 million (R$0.75/share, 9.6% yield) was approved and distributed.
