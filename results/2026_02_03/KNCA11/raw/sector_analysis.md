Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Brazilian Paper/Agro sector, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Brazilian Paper/Agro sector:

### Commodity/Input Prices

*   **Iron Ore:** On February 4, 2026, Iron Ore traded at $102.16 USD/T. Over the past month, the price has fallen 3.74%, and it is down 2.53% compared to the same time last year. The premium for Brazilian high-grade iron ore (65% Fe) over Australian ore (62% Fe) is 7.5%, showing signs of a possible uptrend. In the Brazilian domestic market, reference prices are $95/mt for the ore and $113/mt for pellets.
*   **Pulp:** In Q1 2026, pulp prices in Latin America plummeted by 18%. As of August 7, 2025, China (net) prices for BHKP and NBSK were US$495/t and US$690/t, respectively. Europe (gross) prices for BHKP and NSBK were US$1,048/t and US$1,506/t, respectively. Chinese BHKP futures were at US$500/t for Sep'25. In July 2025, Brazil's pulp exports increased by 10% YoY but decreased by 2% MoM.
*   **CBIOs (Carbon Credits):** In October 2024, CBIO prices rose by 17% over two weeks to R$91 ($16), the highest level since May, driven by demand to meet 2024 goals under Brazil's Renovabio policy. As of June 16, 2025, the average CBIO price was R$59.50, recovering slightly from R$59.30 ($10.70) on May 13, which was the lowest since September 2022. On February 3, 2026, the last trade for CBIOs was R$ 29,60.
*   **Brent Oil:** Weaker oil prices pressured Petrobras, with prices retreating amid easing concerns over supply disruptions in Iran.

### Interest Rates & Inflation

*   **Selic Rate:** As of August 23, 2025, Brazil's Selic rate stood at 15 percent, the highest in nearly two decades. As of September 2, 2025, the Secretary of Agricultural Policy at Brazil's Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock acknowledged that with the Selic rate at 15%, farmers are cautious about taking on loans. As of January 17, 2026, high interest rates (Selic at 15%) are directly impacting the high indebtedness of the agricultural sector.
*   **IPCA (Inflation):** In 2024, rising food prices pushed up inflation in Brazil. Food prices rose by 7.69% during the year, pushing up the Broad National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) to 4.83%. As of May 2022, the 12-month IPCA hit above 12 percent.

### Regulatory Actions

*   **ANP (National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels):** On August 7, 2025, ANP approved changes to the rules for authorizing the production of biofuels, aiming to improve operational safety and supply guarantee, and to expand the list of products in compliance with the National Biofuels Policy (RenovaBio). Preliminary data from the ANP indicates that reports of diesel failing to meet specifications for biodiesel content rose by almost 34% in 2025.
*   **Central Bank:** On January 5, 2026, the Central Bank changed the rules of Proagro to contain expenses and give more predictability to the rural insurance budget for small producers. On April 24, 2025, the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) announced its list of regulatory priorities for 2025 and 2026, including improvements to Open Finance, virtual asset regulations, monitoring AI usage, increased transparency in rural credit, and modernization of payment schemes.
*   **Tax Reform:** A tax reform project was sent to Congress that imposes a 5% tax on "Letras de Crédito do Agronegócio" (LCA) as of January 1, 2026. This initiative, provisional measure 1303/2025, aims to facilitate institutional and private investment in the agricultural business.
*   **Consumption Tax Reform:** The approval of the Brazilian consumption tax reform in 2023 created a VAT system to replace current consumption taxes. Due to the importance of agribusiness, several concessions were made, including a 60% reduction in rates for the supply of agricultural products and certain inputs, and a 100% reduction for vegetables, fruits, and eggs. Basic food basket products will be subject to a zero rate.

### Global Correlation

*   **China:** In December 2025, Brazil exported Wood pulp & paper scrap mostly to China ($546M). China remains the top destination for Brazilian pulp exports, totaling $2 billion in the first half of 2024.
*   **US Fed Rates:** The US Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, bringing it to a range of 4.00% to 4.25% per year.
*   **US Tariffs:** Tariffs imposed by the U.S. impact approximately US$ 11 billion in Brazilian products, with approximately US$ 3 billion in agriculture. Products with a stronger presence in the U.S. market, such as coffee (17% of export value), beef (10%), tobacco (9%), and seafood (56%), are expected to feel the impact of the tariffs.
*   **EU Regulations:** Concerns are building within UK farming over the impact of “dynamic alignment” with EU rules, amid warnings that changes to crop protection regulation could arrive sooner. Tougher European targets for renewable fuel use look set to support demand and premiums for hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO).
*   **Global Trade:** Newly announced trade tariffs and global tensions have increased uncertainty across the market, causing late-March volatility in demand and pricing.
