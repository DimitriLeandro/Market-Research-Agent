Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Hybrid/Logistics sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's an analysis of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Hybrid/Logistics sector in Brazil, based on the latest available data:

**1. Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Iron Ore:** On February 4, 2026, Iron Ore traded flat at $102.16 USD/T. Over the past month, the price has fallen 3.74%, and it is down 2.53% compared to the same time last year. Brazilian high-grade iron ore (65% Fe) is priced at $117/mt, CFR China.
*   **Brent Oil:** On February 3, 2026, Brent Crude was trading at $66.46 per barrel. An expert projects that Brent prices will likely remain in the corridor of $55–65 per barrel in Q1 2026.
*   **Pulp Prices:** I am unable to find specific data points for pulp prices.
*   **CBIOs (Carbon Credits):** As of January 16, 2026, the last trade for CBIOs was R$ 29.60. On February 3, 2026, a trade recap showed CBIOs trading at R$29.60. In October 2024, CBIO prices rose to R91 ($16), the highest level since May.

**2. Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **Selic Rate:** As of January 28, 2026, the Selic rate remains at 15.00%. The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) kept the benchmark interest rate stable at 15.00% p.a.. Minutes from the Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) indicated potential for an interest rate easing cycle to begin at the next meeting on March 18.
*   **IPCA:** I am unable to find specific data points for IPCA.
*   **Impact:** High interest rates may stifle economic activity and make real estate credit more expensive, inhibiting new projects. The construction sector is sensitive to the cost of credit, and a Selic rate of 15% can make many projects unfeasible.

**3. Regulatory Actions:**

*   **ANEEL:** I am unable to find specific data points for ANEEL regulatory actions.
*   **ANP:** On January 27, 2026, ANP granted Brazil's first authorizations for processing 100% renewable feedstock at a refining unit and for the commercialization of Bio-LPG. On December 29, 2025, ANP approved a revised natural gas tariff regime that clarifies capacity contracting rules and establishes a stable pricing mechanism for entry-exit transport operators.
*   **ANS:** I am unable to find specific data points for ANS regulatory actions.
*   **Central Bank:** On January 30, 2026, BCB Instruction No. 701/2026 was released, complementing BCB Resolution No. 520/2025, establishing requirements for independent technical certification for virtual asset service providers. As of February 2, 2026, the market will operate in a clearer environment for stablecoins. In January 2026, the Central Bank updated minimum regulatory capital requirements, introducing a new modular methodology and transition timeline.
*   **New Legislation (Taxes):** Complementary Bill 68/2024 includes an estimated 26.5% cap on the rate of the future Value Added Tax (VAT). A tax reform was approved in December 2023, with a transition period from 2026 to 2033.
*   **New Legislation (Concessions):** I am unable to find specific data points for new legislation regarding concessions.

**4. Global Correlation:**

*   **China Stimulus:** I am unable to find specific data points for China stimulus.
*   **US Fed Rates:** If US labor market indicators reinforce employment stability, expectations that US interest rates will remain high for a prolonged period tend to consolidate, supporting Treasury yields and strengthening the dollar globally. When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, US assets become more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real.
*   **US Tariffs:** In August 2025, Brazil's government rolled out a relief package including 30 billion reais ($5.6 billion) in credit to support local companies impacted by US tariffs. In September 2025, Brazilian exports to the US plummeted due to 50% tariffs, affecting coffee, sugar, and orange juice shipments.
