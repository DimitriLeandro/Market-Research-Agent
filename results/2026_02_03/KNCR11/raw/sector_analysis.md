Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Paper/Receivables sector in Brazil, focusing on external drivers and adhering to the specified format and constraints.

Here's an analysis of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Paper/Receivables sector in Brazil:

*   **Iron Ore Prices:** On February 4, 2026, Iron Ore traded at $102.16 USD/T. Over the past month, the price has fallen 3.74%, and it is down 2.53% compared to the same time last year. Vale forecasts iron ore prices to stabilize around $100/t in 2026. Increased supply from major mining companies and a gradual decline in demand from China are expected to contribute to this stabilization.

*   **Brent Oil Prices:** On February 4, 2026, Brent Crude oil rose to $67.52 USD/Bbl, a 0.28% increase from the previous day. Over the past month, Brent's price has risen 9.33%, but it is still 9.50% lower than a year ago. The EIA projects Brent crude to average $55.08 per barrel in 2026.

*   **Pulp Prices:** On February 4, 2026, Kraft Pulp rose to 5272 CNY/T, up 0.27% from the previous day. Over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 3.51%, and is down 14.42% compared to the same time last year. In late October 2025, the closing price of the main pulp contract was 5,298 RMB/ton. Pulp prices in Latin America plummeted by 18% in Q1.

*   **CBIO Prices:** I am unable to find information on CBIO prices.

*   **Selic Rate:** As of February 2, 2026, the Central Bank of Brazil (BC) maintained the Selic rate stable at 15.00% p.a.. Mixed economic signals may reduce bets for interest rate cuts at the March Copom meeting. Keeping interest rates at 15% is a concern for the Brazilian productive sector. A Selic rate of 15% makes many projects unviable.

*   **IPCA:** Annual inflation in Brazil reached 4.5% in the first half of January 2026. Central bankers project this rate will decrease to 3.2% by the third quarter of 2027.

*   **Regulatory Actions (ANEEL):** In 2025, ANEEL cancelled 509 permits for solar PV and wind power projects. ANEEL proposed changes to the White Hourly Tariff, and low-voltage consumers who consume more than 1.000 kWh/month may be automatically migrated to this model by the end of 2026.

*   **Regulatory Actions (Central Bank):** On April 24, 2025, the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) announced its regulatory priorities for 2025 and 2026, including Open Finance, virtual asset regulations, AI usage monitoring, and expansion of Pix functionalities. The BCB will review bank fee regulations.

*   **China Stimulus:** China's integrated pulp and paper production expansion is likely to reduce imports.

*   **US Fed Rates:** On February 2, 2026, the Federal Reserve decided to maintain interest rates.
