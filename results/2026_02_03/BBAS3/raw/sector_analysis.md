Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Brazilian Financials sector, focusing on external drivers and adhering to the specified format and constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Brazilian Financials sector:

*   **Interest Rates & Inflation:**
    *   The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) held the Selic interest rate steady at 15.00% in its final 2025 meetings.
    *   January's inflation print was slightly cooler than expected at 4.4% YoY.
    *   Inflation expectations for 2025 and 2026 remain elevated at 4.5% and 4.2%, respectively.
    *   The BCB projects inflation at 3.3% for the second quarter of 2027.
    *   The IPCA inflation surprise for the last 12 months was reported at 4.460% in November 2025.
    *   The Copom (Monetary Policy Committee) maintained the Selic rate at 15.00% but signaled that the easing cycle will begin in 2026.

*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   The Central Bank of Brazil has established new rules regarding the minimum capital required for financial institutions, rising to USD 1.68 billion by 2028.
    *   The new minimum capital will be calculated based on firms' activities, not the type of institution.
    *   The new rules regarding minimum capital take effect immediately, with implementation rolled out in phases through January 2028.
    *   The Central Bank of Brazil issued BCB Instruction No. 701/2026, complementing BCB Resolution No. 520/2025, establishing requirements for independent technical certification for virtual asset service providers.
    *   As of February 2, 2026, the market will operate in a clearer environment for stablecoins, with standards for proof of reserves, governance, and disclosure.
    *   The BCB issued Resolution No. 518 on November 11, 2025, amending rules on opening, maintaining, and closing payment accounts to strengthen safeguards against irregular practices.
    *   Non-authorized payment institutions must apply for BCB accreditation to operate within Brazil's Pix instant payment system between January 1, 2026, and May 1, 2026.
    *   The Brazilian government published Provisional Measure No. 1,303/2025, increasing the taxation of Interest on Net Equity (INE) payments from 15% to 20%, effective January 1, 2026.
    *   A 5% withholding tax on income from certain financial investments related to real estate and agribusiness is effective from January 1, 2026.
    *   The tax rate on online betting operations will increase from 12% to 18% starting October 1, 2025.

*   **Global Correlation:**
    *   Weaker commodity prices and the US appointment of a more hawkish Federal Reserve chair pressured the Ibovespa.
    *   The US is the largest source of foreign investment in Brazil.
    *   Chinese direct investment in Brazil more than doubled in 2024, reaching $4.2 billion.
    *   China's new stimulus package disappointed market expectations, leading to a downturn in the Brazilian stock market.
    *   USDBRL should reflect US Payroll, Copom minutes, US government shutdown, geopolitical fears, and ECB decision.
    *   If US labor market indicators reinforce the reading of employment stability, the expectation that US interest rates will remain high for a prolonged period tends to consolidate, supporting Treasury yields and strengthening the dollar globally.
    *   The intensification of tensions involving the US and Iran increases global risk aversion, favoring "safe-haven" assets and potentially hurting emerging market currencies, such as the real.

*   **Commodity/Input Prices:**
    *   Weakening iron ore prices and operational setbacks at Vale contributed to a decline in the Ibovespa.
    *   The Ibovespa edged down due to weaker commodity prices.

*   **Other Macroeconomic Factors:**
    *   Brazil's gross public debt eased to 78.7% of GDP in December.
    *   Brazil's industrial output growth for December came in at 0.4%, missing the predicted 1% increase.
    *   The unemployment rate held at 5.1%.
    *   Brazil's GDP growth accelerated to 3.2 and 3.4 percent in 2023 and 2024, respectively.
    *   In 2025, non-resident investors accounted for the majority of trading volume in Brazil's cash equity market.
