Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Financials sector in Brazil, focusing on the external environment and adhering to the specified format and constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Brazilian Financials sector:

*   **Iron Ore Prices:**
    *   The price of Brazilian 65% Fe iron ore is $117/mt, CFR China. This is a slight decrease from $118/mt one week prior.
    *   Iron Ore traded flat at $102.16 USD/T on February 4, 2026. Over the past month, Iron Ore's price has fallen 3.74%, and is down 2.53% compared to the same time last year.
    *   Vale's iron ore fines prices fell to an average $91.6/t in 2025 from $95.3/t in 2024.
    *   Increased iron ore inventories in 35 ports in China have reached a total of 153 million mt. Uncertainties regarding the future demand for the ore are also playing a negative role in prices.

*   **Brent Oil Prices:**
    *   There is no significant association between CBIO prices and Brent oil.

*   **Pulp Prices:**
    *   Kraft Pulp rose to 5272 CNY/T on February 4, 2026.
    *   Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 3.51% over the past month and is down 14.42% compared to the same time last year.
    *   Historically, Kraft Pulp reached an all-time high of 8660 in September 2022.
    *   In December 2025, Brazil exported $947M and imported $15.2M of Wood pulp & paper scrap, resulting in a positive trade balance of $932M.
    *   Pulp prices in Latin America plummeted by 18% in Q1, putting direct pressure on forestry sector operating income and overall profits.

*   **CBIO Prices:**
    *   Average CBIO trading prices are at their lowest levels since 2022.
    *   The average CBIO price was R$59.30 ($10.70) on May 13, 2025, its lowest since September 2022, when it hit R$61.20. Since then the price has recovered slightly, reaching R$59.50 on June 12, 2025.
    *   In October 2024, CBio prices rose by 17% over two weeks to R$91 ($16), the highest level since May.
    *   The price of CBIOS reached a record high of R$ 104.50, which is 93.4% above its historical average of R$ 52.12.

*   **Interest Rates (Selic) & Inflation (IPCA):**
    *   The Central Bank of Brazil's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) maintained the Selic at 15% per year.
    *   The benchmark Selic rate held at 15% is its highest level since July 2006.
    *   High interest rates have traditionally bolstered net interest margins (NIMs) for Brazilian banks, as the 15% Selic rate has translated into elevated lending rates.
    *   Brazil's credit growth reached 11.5% in 2024.
    *   The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) unanimously raised the benchmark interest rate (Selic) by 50 basis points to 14.75% on May 7.
    *   Annual inflation in Brazil reached 4.5% in the first half of January 2026. Central bankers project this rate will decrease to 3.2% by the third quarter of 2027.
    *   The Central Bank of Brazil has signaled a "very prolonged period" of restrictive policy to anchor inflation expectations within its 1.5% to 4.5% target range.
    *   Headline inflation has moderated to 4.7% year-on-year in October 2025.
    *   The IMF projects global headline inflation to decline from 4.1% in 2025, to 3.8% in 2026 and further to 3.4% in 2027.

*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   The Brazilian financial sector regulatory structure is comprised of four specific regulators: CVM (securities), Central Bank (prudential & financial institution supervision), SUSEP (insurance) and PREVIC (pension).
    *   The Central Bank of Brazil sets regulations for the financial sector, focusing on the stability, security, and transparency of financial transactions.
    *   The Central Bank is responsible for regulation of the government debt market, including supervision of sales practices, business conduct and investor protection.
    *   The National Monetary Council (CMN) is the highest normative authority of the National Financial System (SFN).
    *   Brazil introduced Law No. 14,286, reforming rules governing its foreign exchange market and international capital flows. The changes took effect at the end of 2022.
    *   The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) will oversee eligibility criteria, ensuring compliance while opening doors to greater financial flexibility.
    *   Another key reform eliminates the mandatory registration of foreign capital inflows with the BCB.

*   **Global Correlation:**
    *   The Brazilian stock market, Ibovespa, experienced a downturn on Tuesday. Investors reacted to China's new stimulus package, which disappointed market expectations.
    *   Concerns about slowing economic indicators in China for September added to the market's unease.
    *   Chinese companies invested $2.2 billion in Brazil in the first six months of 2025.
    *   Brazil was the emerging economy that attracted the most Chinese productive investments in 2024, with US$ 4.18 billion across 39 projects.
    *   The BCB noted an expected slowdown in US growth due to tariffs and ongoing uncertainty around global demand, supply chains, and consumer behavior.
    *   The IMF projects global headline inflation to decline from 4.1% in 2025, to 3.8% in 2026 and further to 3.4% in 2027.
    *   External factors such as US economic conditions and global financial volatility continue to affect emerging markets.
    *   The EU-Mercosur free trade agreement continues to move forward.
