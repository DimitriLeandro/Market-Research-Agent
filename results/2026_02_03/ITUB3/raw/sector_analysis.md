Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Financials sector in Brazil, focusing on the external environment and adhering to the specified format and constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Financials sector in Brazil, based on the research objectives:

*   **Interest Rates:** The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) has maintained the Selic rate at 15.00%. The BCB's Monetary Policy Committee (COPOM) has emphasized the need to maintain restrictive interest rates until the disinflation process is consolidated and expectations align with targets. Interest rate changes have a significant impact on economic performance, with rate hikes slowing down growth by reducing investment and consumption. The benchmark interest rate in Brazil is expected to be 14.50% by the end of this quarter. In the long-term, the Brazil Interest Rate is projected to trend around 10.50% in 2027.

*   **Inflation:** Annual inflation in Brazil reached 4.5% in the first half of January. Central bankers project this rate will decrease to 3.2% by the third quarter of 2027. Inflation expectations for 2025 and 2026 remain elevated at 4.5% and 4.2% respectively. The BCB projects inflation at 3.3% for the second quarter of 2027.

*   **Regulatory Actions:** In 2026, the Brazilian financial sector is expected to undergo substantial regulatory developments, reflecting the strategic priorities under the BCB’s regulatory agenda. These initiatives aim to enhance transparency, operational resilience, and legal certainty, while fostering innovation and aligning domestic standards with international best practices. The Central Bank of Brazil has established new rules regarding the minimum capital required for financial institutions to operate in Brazil. Starting from 2028, the minimum will rise to USD 1.68 billion from approximately USD 950 million. BCB Instruction No. 701/2026 complements BCB Resolution No. 520/2025, establishing requirements for independent technical certification for virtual asset service providers.

*   **Global Correlation:** US labor market indicators reinforcing employment stability could lead to expectations that US interest rates will remain high, supporting Treasury yields and strengthening the dollar globally. Intensification of tensions involving the US and Iran increases global risk aversion, favoring "safe-haven" assets and potentially hurting emerging market currencies, such as the real. A US government shutdown could intensify aversion to the dollar and stimulate portfolio diversification toward emerging markets, benefiting the real. Disappointing market expectations for China's stimulus package caused the Brazilian stock market, Ibovespa, to experience a downturn.

*   **Commodities:** The Brazilian economy is largely based on the export of commodities, such as food, iron ore and oil. The prices of these products are determined in the international market by changes in global demand and can be affected by trade policies of major world economic powers.

*   **Fiscal Policy:** Expansionary fiscal policy remains a key stimulus, with the BCB explicitly calling for decreased government spending and better monetary-fiscal coordination. The government has embarked on a series of short-term unconventional measures to increase revenue and generate enough fiscal space to increase spending further.
