Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Financials/Infrastructure sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Financials/Infrastructure sector in Brazil:

**1. Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Iron Ore:** The price of Brazilian 65% Fe iron ore is $117/mt, CFR China, as of **February 4, 2026**. This is a slight decrease from $118/mt one week prior. In the Brazilian domestic market, reference prices are $95/mt for the ore and $113/mt for pellets, ex-works and excluding taxes. Iron Ore 62% price today is 102.17. Over the past month, Iron Ore's price has fallen 3.74%, and is down 2.53% compared to the same time last year.
*   **Brent Crude Oil:** Brent rose to $67.52 USD/Bbl on **February 4, 2026**, up 0.28% from the previous day. Over the past month, Brent's price has risen 9.33%, but it is still 9.50% lower than a year ago. The current price of Brent Oil futures is 67.39, with a previous close of 67.33.
*   **Pulp Prices:** Kraft Pulp was at 5,272 CNY/T on **February 4, 2026**, up 0.27% from the previous day. Over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 3.51%, and is down 14.42% compared to the same time last year. In 2025, Brazil's exports of BHKP grew by 6.7% year-on-year to 19.53 million tons. The total export value declined by 11% to $8.54 billion, as the average export price fell by 16% to $437 per ton.
*   **CBIOs (Brazilian Decarbonization Credits):** The average CBIO price was R$59.30 ($10.70) on **May 13, 2025**, its lowest since **September 2022**. On **June 12, 2025**, the price had recovered slightly, reaching R$59.50. As of **June 2025**, the number of CBIOs held by biofuel producers reached historic highs at 16.2 million certificates.

**2. Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **Selic Rate:** As of **January 2026**, Brazil's central bank maintained its benchmark interest rate at 15.00%. The central bank initiated a monetary tightening cycle in **September 2024**, when the base rate was at 10.50%, gradually increasing the Selic to 14.25% to curb inflation. A weekly central bank survey with analysts published on **April 15, 2025** showed that the Selic was expected to rise to 15% by year-end.
*   **Impact of Selic:** High interest rates are undermining investor trust. High interest rates constrain consumer and business credit, especially in interest-sensitive sectors like retail, autos, and housing.
*   **Inflation (IPCA):** Annual inflation remains above the central bank's target. The country's twelve-month inflation rate reached 5.1 percent in **August 2025**, still well above the target. Inflation expectations stand at 4.0% for 2026 and 3.8% for 2027, and Copom projects inflation at 3.2% by the third quarter of 2027.

**3. Regulatory Actions:**

*   **Central Bank of Brazil (BCB):** In **January 2026**, BCB Instruction No. 701/2026 complemented BCB Resolution No. 520/2025, establishing requirements for independent technical certification for virtual asset intermediation and custody services. In **November 2025**, the BCB updated the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, treating certain crypto asset transactions as "foreign exchange and international capital market operations".
*   **Law No. 14,286:** Brazil's FX framework was significantly modernized by Law No 14,286, regulated by BCB Resolution No 277 and No 278, of **December 31, 2022**. This reform introduced a flexible principles-based regime aligned with international standards, aimed at enhancing legal certainty, transparency, and operational efficiency in the domestic FX market.
*   **Digital Markets Bill:** In **September 2026**, the Brazilian government submitted to Congress an ambitious digital markets bill to tackle the economic power of Big Tech.

**4. Global Correlation:**

*   **China:** Chinese investment in Brazil reached an eight-year high in the first half of 2025, totaling $1.7 billion. Chinese companies captured 80 percent of Brazil's EV market share in the first half of 2025. Chinese direct investments in capital holdings in Brazil totaled $379 million in the first half of 2025, surpassing any annual result since 2018.
*   **US Fed Rates:** Lower interest rates in the United States could attract investment to Brazil and create room for cuts in the Selic rate. When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, US assets become more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real.
*   **US Tariffs:** Tariffs of 50% imposed by the U.S. on Brazil are enabling China to gain ground in the Brazilian market.
*   **EU-Mercosur Agreement:** The Brazilian Congress wants to vote as quickly as possible on the trade agreement between the European Union and Mercosur.
