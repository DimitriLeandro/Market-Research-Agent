*   **[02/27/2025]** A Brazilian Federal Court overturned a preventive measure imposed by CADE (Administrative Council for Economic Defense) on Itaú Unibanco, which was investigating alleged anti-competitive practices related to barriers in digital wallet transactions by competitors. The court found that Itaú's documents suggested a violation of the right to defense and due process. The original CADE ruling would have required Itaú to cease the practices within 30 days, with a R$250,000 daily fine for non-compliance. The investigation stemmed from a complaint by the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, alerted by the Brazilian Internet Association (ABRANET), after PicPay (an ABRANET member) reported "indiscriminate refusals" by Itaú to process digital wallet transactions. Itaú denied any irregularities, citing high default rates and the need to prevent household over-indebtedness.
