Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Financials sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Financials sector in Brazil, as of February 4, 2026:

### Commodity/Input Prices

*   **Iron Ore:** The price of Brazilian 65% Fe iron ore is $117/mt, CFR China. This is a slight decrease from $118/mt one week prior. In the Brazilian domestic market, reference prices are $95/mt for the ore and $113/mt for pellets, ex-works and excluding taxes.
*   **Iron Ore (62%):** Iron Ore traded flat at $102.16 USD/T on February 4, 2026. Over the past month, Iron Ore's price has fallen 3.74%, and is down 2.53% compared to the same time last year.
*   **Brent Crude Oil:** The price is $66.50/bbl, a +0.30% change. In May 2025, the Crude Oil, exp, BR price was approximately 350 BRL per Bbl, representing an 11.1% decline compared to the previous month and a 1.8% decrease YoY.
*   **CBIOs (Carbon Credits):** The average CBIO price was R$59.30 ($10.70) on May 13, 2025, its lowest since September 2022. On June 12, 2025, the price had recovered slightly to R$59.50. Platts began publishing a price assessment for CBIOs in June 2024. On February 3, 2026, the last CBIO trade was R$29,60.

### Interest Rates & Inflation

*   **Selic Rate:** The Selic rate is currently at 15.00%, unchanged. The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) kept the rate unchanged for the sixth consecutive meeting. Markets are pricing in a 50bp rate cut to 14.50% from March 2026.
*   **IPCA Inflation:** Annual inflation in Brazil reached 4.5% in the first half of January 2026. Central bankers project this rate will decrease to 3.2% by the third quarter of 2027. In December 2024, the Extended National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) hit 0.52%, with a cumulative increase of 4.83% in 2024.

### Regulatory Actions

*   **Tax Reform:** Complementary Law 227/2026 was published on January 14, 2026, containing additional regulations for the Tax Reform on Consumption. From 2027 to 2033, financial services will be taxed at increasing IBS and CBS rates, from 10.85% to 12.5%, with automatic reduction where ISS also applies.
*   **Financial Infrastructure Operators:** A bill on financial infrastructure operators, from 2023 and authored by the current federal government, has been approved by the Chamber of Deputies and is being processed by Senate committees.
*   **Data Centers:** A Provisional Measure creating a Special Tax Regime for Data Center Services (Redata) was submitted by the government in September and needs to be approved by a joint committee by February 25th to avoid lapsing.
*   **Overseas Recognition Regime (ORR):** The ORR Regulations, made on October 30 and in force on November 28, 2025, consolidate existing ORRs under the Short Selling Regulations 2025 and the Insurance and Reinsurance Undertakings (Prudential Requirements) Regulations 2023.

### Global Correlation

*   **US Fed Rates:** If US labor market indicators reinforce employment stability, expectations that US interest rates will remain high for a prolonged period tend to consolidate, supporting Treasury yields and strengthening the dollar globally.
*   **China:** Increased iron ore inventories in 35 ports in China have reached a total of 153 million mt, 2.77 million mt more in just one week. Uncertainties regarding the future demand for the ore are also playing a negative role in prices.
*   **Geopolitical Tensions:** Intensification of tensions involving the US and Iran increases global risk aversion, favoring "safe-haven" assets and potentially hurting emerging market currencies, such as the real.
*   **US Tariffs:** The increase in trade barriers may initially seem like a sectoral issue, but one of the main positive effects is the redirection of investments, as global companies facing restrictions in the US may seek alternative suppliers, benefiting Brazil, particularly in the agricultural and industrial sectors.
