Okay, I will act as a Financial Auditor and Forensic Accountant to extract the requested financial data for RZTR11 from its most recent quarterly results and management guidance. I will focus on identifying the specific numbers for the last reported quarter versus the same quarter last year (YoY) for Net Revenue, EBITDA (Adjusted) and Margin, Net Income and Margin, Operating Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow, and any management guidance for the full year. I will then present the findings in a raw data log format, using exact numbers and explicitly stating the percentage growth or decline where available, along with the reasons for the changes.

Based on the search results, it's challenging to extract the specific financial data for RZTR11's most recent quarter (likely Q4 2025) versus the same quarter last year (Q4 2024) in a consolidated format. Many results focus on dividends, general information, or news updates, rather than a detailed breakdown of financial performance metrics.

However, I can provide some extracted data points and context from the search results:

**RZTR11 - Financial Data Log (Incomplete)**

*   **Dividend Yield:** 12.19%
*   **Monthly Dividend:** R$ 1.00 per share (as of Nov/Dec 2025)
*   **Dividend Yield (February 2026):** 1.01% based on share price of R$ 98.54 in January 2026
*   **Share Price:** R$ 97.09 (as of January 2026), a 27.50% increase YTD
*   **Recent Sale:** Commitment to sell property for R$ 18.5 million, with staggered payments

**Additional Contextual Information:**

*   RZTR11 focuses on long-term returns through agricultural properties, using strategies like Sale & Leaseback and Buy to Lease.
*   The fund announced a distribution of R$ 0.95 per share in November 2025.
*   The fund has net assets of R$ 1.93 billion.

**Missing Data:**

*   Net Revenue (Receita Líquida)
*   EBITDA (Adjusted) and EBITDA Margin
*   Net Income (Lucro Líquido) and Net Margin
*   Operating Cash Flow
*   Free Cash Flow
*   Specific management guidance for the full year (Production, Capex, Costs)

To fulfill the request completely, access to the official quarterly earnings release document or financial statements for RZTR11 is necessary.
