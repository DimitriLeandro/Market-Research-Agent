Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Brazilian insurance sector, focusing on the external environment and adhering to the specified constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Brazilian insurance sector:

### Commodity/Input Prices:

*   **CBIOs (Decarbonization Credits):** On January 16, 2026, the last trade of CBIOs was R$ 29,60. On June 12, 2025, the average CBIO price was R$59.30 ($10.70), the lowest since September 2022. By June 12, 2025, the price had slightly recovered to R$59.50. In October 2024, CBIO prices rose by 17% over two weeks, reaching R$91 ($16), the highest level since May 2024. Platts began publishing price assessments for CBIOs in June 2024.

### Interest Rates & Inflation:

*   **Selic Rate:** On February 2, 2026, the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) decided to keep the Selic rate stable at 15.00% p.a. for the fourth consecutive time. However, the post-decision statement anticipated a potential easing cycle at the next meeting on March 18, 2026. As of February 3, 2026, the Selic rate remained steady at 9.5%.
*   **Inflation (IPCA):** January 2026 saw a slightly cooler-than-expected inflation print of 4.4% YoY.
*   **Impact of Interest Rates:** Modestly rising interest rates are generally positive for the insurance industry because when rates rise at a reasonable pace, portfolio yields also rise. Life insurers, in particular, benefit from a rising interest rate environment as they're likely to earn improved spreads over the cost of funding liabilities.
*   Drops in interest rates can decrease an insurance company's liabilities by decreasing its future obligations to policyholders. However, lower interest rates can also make the insurance company's products less attractive, resulting in lower sales and, thus, lower income in the form of premiums that the insurance company has available to invest.

### Regulatory Actions:

*   **Brazilian Insurance Act (Law No. 15.040/2024):** This act went into effect on December 11, 2025, revoking provisions of the Brazilian Civil Code that previously governed insurance contracts. It introduces changes affecting operations, underwriting, products, claims, reinsurance, and time limitation.
*   **SUSEP Regulations:** Enabling regulations from SUSEP (Superintendência de Seguros Privados) are expected during the spring-summer of 2025.
*   **CNSP Resolution 451/2022:** Effective from January 1, 2023, this resolution amended the maximum reinsurance cessions for local insurers.
*   **IOF Tax Changes (May/June 2025):**
    *   On May 22, 2025, the Brazilian Federal Government issued Decree No. 12,466/2025, which increased the rates of the Tax on Financial Transactions (IOF) applicable to credit, foreign exchange, and insurance transactions.
    *   A new regulation, Decree No. 12,499/2025, was published on June 11, 2025, introducing adjustments to the IOF increase package.
    *   A 5% IOF rate is levied if individual contributions to life insurance policies with a survival benefit exceed BRL 600,000 annually starting January 1, 2026.
    *   The IOF rate on foreign exchange transactions for the transfer of funds abroad increased from 0.38% to 3.5%, affecting reinsurance premiums remitted to international reinsurers.
*   **ANEEL Regulations:** ANEEL has published updated regulations on network resilience to support distributors and transmitters in preparing for emergency situations.
*   **Public Consultation No. 10/2025:** This introduces rules for greater transparency for insureds and beneficiaries, requiring changes to policy wordings.

### Global Correlation:

*   **US Fed Rate Impact:** If US labor market indicators reinforce employment stability, expectations that US interest rates will remain high for a prolonged period tend to consolidate, supporting Treasury yields and strengthening the dollar globally.
*   **China Stimulus:** China is likely to balance stimulus and reform with its 15th Five-Year Plan, focusing on debt sustainability and a 5% growth target. In November 2024, China decreased the residential property deed tax for first-time buyers.
*   **Global Commodity Prices:** Fluctuations in commodity prices, the supply of foreign capital, and the ability to attract foreign capital can lead to recurrent fiscal shocks, high inflation, and foreign exchange depreciation.
*   **US Tariffs:** Greater certainty regarding US tariffs is expected, either through affirmation of IEEPA tariffs or repositioning at the sector level.
*   **Eurozone Interest Rates:** Maintaining the benchmark rate in the Eurozone tends to support the appreciation of the euro against the dollar, which could indirectly benefit the Real.
*   **Geopolitical Tensions:** Intensification of tensions involving the US and Iran increases global risk aversion, favoring "safe-haven" assets and potentially hurting emerging market currencies like the Real.
