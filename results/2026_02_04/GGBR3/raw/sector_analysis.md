Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Materials/Steel sector in Brazil, focusing on the external environment and adhering to the specified constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Materials/Steel sector in Brazil:

*   **Iron Ore Prices:** On **February 4, 2026**, Iron Ore prices reached $102.17 USD/T. Over the past month, Iron Ore's price has fallen 3.73%, and is down 2.52% compared to the same time last year.
*   **Steel Production**: Steel production in Brazil decreased to 2,600 Thousand tonnes in **December 2025**, from 2,800 Thousand tonnes in **November 2025**.
*   **Steel Imports**: In **August 2025**, Brazilian steel imports experienced a 24% year-on-year decline.
*   **Import Tariffs**: As of **May 2025**, Brazil extended its 25% tariff-quota system on 23 imported steel products for 12 more months, starting in **June**. All 23 steel products remain subject to an import tax of 9-16%, with a 25% tariff applying if the quota is exceeded.
*   **Anti-dumping Duties**: In **January 2026**, Brazil's Foreign Trade Chamber confirmed five-year antidumping duties on imports of pre-painted steel from China and India.
*   **Selic Rate**: In **September 2025**, Brazil's Central Bank maintained the Selic rate at 15%, which is the highest level in nearly two decades. This high interest rate has stalled investment across steel-intensive industries like construction and manufacturing.
*   **Inflation**: In **January 2026**, Brazil's headline inflation decelerated to an annual 4.26% in **December**.
*   **US Tariffs**: A study by IPEA (**December 2025**) estimated that a 25% U.S. tariff could cause a 2.19% drop in Brazilian steel output, an 11.27% contraction in metal exports, and a 1.09% decline in imports. This could mean export losses equivalent to US$1.5 billion and an output reduction of nearly 700,000 tonnes in 2025.
*   **Chinese Steel Imports**: In the first quarter of **2025**, flat-steel imports increased 42% year-on-year, with some product types recording a Chinese share of 91.5% of total imports.
*   **Aço Brasil**: In **December 2023**, Aço Brasil was lobbying the government for an increase in antidumping duties, from the current 9.6% rate to a 25% tax on imported steel.
*   **CBIO Prices**: The average CBIO price was R$59.30 ($10.70) on **May 13, 2025**, its lowest since **September 2022**. On **June 12, 2025**, the price had recovered slightly, reaching R$59.50. On **February 3, 2026**, CBIO Last Trade was R$ 29,60.
*   **Industrial Output**: Brazil's industrial output fell by 1.2% in **December** from a month prior, marking the steepest decline since **July 2024**, according to national statistics agency IBGE.
*   **Market Size**: The size of Brazil's steel market will reach US$16.56 billion in **2024**. CAGR predicts that the annual growth rate will be around 4% from 2025 to 2033, and the market is expected to reach US$24.85 billion by 2033.
*   **Brazilian Ministry of Development, Industry, Trade and Services (MDIC)**: In the first half of 2024, the Brazilian Ministry of Development, Industry, Commerce and Services (MDIC) established a quota-tariff trade defense system, which was renewed in 2025.
*   **Global Steel Demand**: Global steel demand in 2025 is expected to remain stable compared with 2024, reaching around 1.750 million tonnes. Sector specialists forecast a 1.3% recovery for 2026, raising global demand to 1.772 million tonnes.
