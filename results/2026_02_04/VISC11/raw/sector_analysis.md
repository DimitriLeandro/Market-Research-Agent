Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic analysis of the Brazilian Shopping Malls sector, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers impacting the Brazilian Shopping Malls sector:

*   **Commodity/Input Prices:**
    *   **Iron Ore:** The price of Iron Ore is $102.16 USD/T as of February 3, 2026. Iron ore increased to $100.77 USD/T, the highest since April 2025. Over the past 4 weeks, Iron Ore gained 4.67%, but in the last 12 months, it decreased 4.26%. In December 2025, the global iron ore price was $107.59.
    *   **Brent Oil:** The price of Brent Crude Oil is $67.40 USD as of February 4, 2026.
    *   **CBIOs (Decarbonization Credits):** CBIOs are part of the National Biofuels Policy (RenovaBio) and are used to meet CO₂ reduction targets. Each CBIO represents one metric ton of CO₂ avoided. Fuel distributors are required to purchase CBIOs to offset emissions from fossil fuel sales.

*   **Interest Rates & Inflation:**
    *   **Selic Rate:** The Selic rate, Brazil's benchmark interest rate, is currently held at 15.00%. The Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) held the rate steady for the fifth consecutive meeting in January, while signaling a possible easing cycle beginning in March. This is the highest policy rate since July 2006. The Selic rate ended 2024 at 12.25%.
    *   **Inflation (IPCA):** Brazil's annual inflation rate eased to 4.26% in December 2025, the lowest since August 2024. Brazil's official inflation, measured by the Extended National Consumer Price Index (IPCA), concluded 2024 at 4.83%. This exceeded the central bank's target of 3% and surpassed the upper tolerance limit of 4.5%. The Consumer Price Index in Brazil increased 0.33 percent in December of 2025 over the previous month.
    *   **Impact:** High interest rates are expected to weigh on investment in 2026.

*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   **Central Bank of Brazil (BCB):** The BCB issued measures to strengthen the safety of the National Financial System in September 2025. Non-authorized payment institutions must apply for BCB accreditation to operate within Brazil's Pix instant payment system between January 1, 2026, and May 1, 2026. BCB Instruction No. 701/2026 establishes requirements for independent technical certification for virtual asset service providers.
    *   **Trade Reciprocity Law:** Decree No. 12,551/2025 regulates Brazil's Trade Reciprocity Law, establishing criteria for suspending trade and investment concessions in response to measures impacting Brazil's international competitiveness.
    *   **Infrastructure Debentures:** Law No. 14,801/2024 introduces a new category of infrastructure debentures with tax benefits for issuers.
    *   **Regulatory Sandbox:** The BCB's Regulatory Sandbox licenses entities to test innovative projects under specific regulatory provisions.

*   **Global Correlation:**
    *   **US Fed Rates:** The US Federal Reserve maintained its benchmark interest rates. Rising US Federal Reserve interest rates can make US assets more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real.
    *   **China:** China's stimulus package fell short of market expectations, impacting iron ore and oil prices. Chinese companies invested $2.2 billion in Brazil in the first six months of 2025, a 5% increase compared to the same period a year earlier.
    *   **US Tariffs:** US tariffs have driven Brazil to seek closer collaboration with China.
    *   **US Tariffs and Interest Rates:** Industrial output in Brazil expanded by only 0.6% in 2025, partly due to pressure from U.S. tariffs and a high Selic rate.
    *   **US Dollar:** The Brazilian Real has strengthened against the US dollar due to domestic monetary conditions and a weaker US dollar environment.
    *   **Global Instability:** In periods of global instability, investors tend to reduce their exposure to emerging markets, leading to capital outflows and pressuring stock prices and market liquidity.
