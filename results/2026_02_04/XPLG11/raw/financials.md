Okay, I understand. I will act as a Financial Auditor and Forensic Accountant, focusing on extracting the hard financial data for XPLG11 from its most recent Quarterly Results (Earnings Release) and Management Guidance. I will provide a raw data log with precise numbers, YoY comparisons (including % growth/decline), and context on the changes.

Based on the search results, here's the financial data log for XPLG11:

**XPLG11 - Financial Data Log**

*Note:* It's challenging to provide a complete data log with YoY comparisons for the specific metrics requested (Net Revenue, EBITDA, Net Income, Operating Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow) directly from the search results. Many results focus on dividends, fund analysis, and general information rather than detailed financial statements. However, I can provide some relevant information and context.

*   Recent news includes the approval of a change in the fund's administrator and custodian.

I will continue searching for more specific financial data related to revenue, EBITDA, net income, and cash flow. However, based on the available search results, this is the most comprehensive financial data log I can create at this time.
