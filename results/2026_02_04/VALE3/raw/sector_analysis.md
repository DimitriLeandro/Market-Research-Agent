Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Brazilian mining sector, focusing on external drivers and adhering to the specified constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Brazilian mining sector:

*   **Iron Ore Prices:**
    *   On February 4, 2026, Iron Ore CNY fell to 781.50 CNY/T, a 0.13% decrease from the previous day. Over the past month, Iron Ore CNY's price has decreased by 1.57%, and it is down 2.92% compared to the same time last year.
    *   Iron Ore increased to 100.77 USD/T, the highest since April 2025.
    *   Iron ore fines 62% Fe CFR Futures price was $102.16 on Feb 03, 2026. The 52-week range is $93.41 to $108.48. Over the past year, the price has changed by -2.53%.
    *   Iron Ore is down 3.74% over the last month.

*   **Brent Oil Prices:**
    *   Brent crude oil rose to $67.52 USD/Bbl on February 4, 2026, a 0.28% increase from the previous day. Over the past month, Brent's price has risen 9.33%, but it is still 9.50% lower than a year ago.
    *   Brent Crude Oil price is $67.48. The 52 week range is $58.40 - $81.40. The 1 year change is -11.27%.

*   **Interest Rates (Selic):**
    *   The Brazil cash rate (Policy Rate: Month End: SELIC) was set at 15.00 % pa in Jan 2026, compared with 15.00 % pa in the previous Dec 2025.
    *   The Central Bank of Brazil maintained its benchmark rate at 15.00% in January, stating that a prolonged hold is needed to keep inflation on a steady path.
    *   A high annual benchmark interest rate of 15 percent is putting constant pressure on the industry.

*   **Inflation (IPCA):**
    *   Brazil's official inflation, measured by the Extended National Consumer Price Index (IPCA), concluded 2024 at 4.83%.
    *   Brazil's central bank maintained its benchmark rate at 15.00% in January, saying a prolonged hold is needed to keep inflation on a steady path toward the target amid elevated uncertainty. Inflation expectations stand at 4.0% for 2026 and 3.8% for 2027, and Copom projects inflation at 3.2% by the third quarter of 2027.

*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   Resolution No. 223/2025, effective from November 23, 2025, updates the sanctioning and penalty regime for infractions in the mining sector. It establishes updated fine amounts and stricter penalty criteria.
    *   Bill No. 2,159/2021, approved by the Chamber of Deputies on July 17, 2025, relaxes environmental licensing for medium-risk activities, including mining.
    *   In April 2025, the National Policy on Strategic Minerals was launched to attract investment and strengthen the supply chain of critical minerals for the energy transition, with fiscal incentives and streamlined permitting.

*   **Global Correlation (China):**
    *   In 2024, 35% of Brazilian mining exports—worth approximately US$23.5 million—were shipped to China. Iron accounts for 85% of the total value of mining exports and 99% of the volume shipped to China.
    *   Chinese investment in the country increased by 113% in 2024, compared to the previous year.

*   **Global Correlation (US):**
    *   Proposed imposition of tariffs of up to 50% on Brazilian mineral exports by the United States may significantly impact projects reliant on U.S.-origin equipment and inputs.
    *   Exports to the United States dropped by 8.6 percent in the second half of 2025.
    *   US tariffs and a high annual benchmark interest rate of 15 percent are dampening Brazil's growth.
    *   Brazil's aluminum products exports already fell around 25% on year in the first half of 2025, "as a direct consequence of the tariffs announced on March 12 and June 4".
    *   When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, US assets become more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real.
