Okay, I'm ready to perform the financial data extraction and create the log. I will focus on finding the specific financial figures for ABCB4, comparing the last reported quarter against the same quarter of the previous year, and noting any management guidance for the full year.

Okay, I have gathered the available financial data for ABCB4. Here's the raw data log, focusing on Q3 2025 results compared to Q3 2024, and any available full-year guidance:

**ABCB4 Financial Data Log**

**1. Top Line: Net Revenue (Receita Líquida)**

*   Q3 2025: Not explicitly stated as "Net Revenue," but "Total Revenues" can be inferred. Several sources provide different values.
    *   StockInvest.us reports Revenue Actual of R$2.223 Billion, compared to an estimate of R$773.749 Million.
    *   Investing.com reports R$761.49 Million for the quarter.
*   Q3 2024:
    *   StockInvest.us reports Revenue Actual of R$740.92M.
*   YoY: Based on the StockInvest.us data, revenue increased significantly. However, there's a large discrepancy between the actual and estimated values, so the percentage change is unreliable.

**2. Operational: EBITDA (Adjusted) and EBITDA Margin**

*   No specific EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA figures were found for Q3 2025 or Q3 2024.

**3. Bottom Line: Net Income (Lucro Líquido) and Net Margin**

*   Q3 2025: R$257 million.
*   Q3 2024: R$255.1 million.
*   YoY: Net income increased slightly.
*   Net Margin (TTM): 41.80%.

**4. Cash Flow: Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow**

*   No specific Operating Cash Flow or Free Cash Flow figures were found for Q3 2025 or Q3 2024.

**5. Guidance:**

*   Portfolio Growth Guidance: Cut from 7-12% to 1-4% for the full year. This was due to a focus on margin and quality over volume.
*   Management expects slower GDP growth, persistent high interest rates, potential increase in corporate defaults, and a continued cautious approach to portfolio expansion.

**Additional Information:**

*   Financial Margin: Record BRL 652 million.
*   Efficiency Ratio: 38.8%.
*   Expenditures grew 3%, below guidance.
*   Expanded credit portfolio grew 4.6% year-on-year.
*   Provisioning increased to 0.7% of portfolio.

**Discrepancies and Notes:**

*   There are inconsistencies in the revenue figures reported by different sources.
*   The Q4 2025 earnings release is scheduled for February 6, 2026.

I have focused on extracting hard financial data and explicitly stating the comparison where available. The discrepancies in revenue figures highlight the importance of consulting the official earnings release for accurate data.
