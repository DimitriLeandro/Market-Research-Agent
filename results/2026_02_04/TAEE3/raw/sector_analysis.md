Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Utilities/Energy sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations. I will present the information in a bulleted list with specific data points and avoid market commentary.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Utilities/Energy sector in Brazil, as of February 4, 2026:

**1. Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Iron Ore:** The price of Brazilian 65% Fe iron ore is $117/mt, CFR China. The domestic reference price is $95/mt. The premium for Brazilian high-grade ore with 65% iron over Australian ore containing 62% iron is 7.5%. Iron Ore traded flat at 102.16 USD/T on February 4, 2026. Over the past month, Iron Ore's price has fallen 3.74%, and is down 2.53% compared to the same time last year.
*   **Brent Oil:** (No specific Brent Oil price for Brazil was found in the search results. General information on oil is included in other sections.)
*   **Pulp Prices:** Kraft Pulp is at 5,272 CNY/T on February 4, 2026, up 0.27% from the previous day. Over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 3.51%, and is down 14.42% compared to the same time last year.
*   **CBIO Prices:** The average CBIO price was R$59.30 ($10.70) on May 13, 2025, its lowest since September 2022. On June 12, 2025, the price recovered slightly, reaching R$59.50. On January 16, 2026, CBIO Last Trade was R$ 29,60.

**2. Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **Selic Rate:** The Central Bank of Brazil maintained the benchmark interest rate at 15.00%. A high Selic rate impacts sector funding.
*   **IPCA:** (Specific impact of IPCA on the sector was not found in the search results. General information on inflation is included in other sections.)
*   **Impact:** High interest rates are burdening the Brazilian economy. Rising financial expenses and potential macro-driven delinquency risks are present. The cost of debt will continue to test companies' financial resilience.

**3. Regulatory Actions:**

*   **Tax Reform:** Complementary Law No. 214/2025 instituted a dual value-added tax (VAT) model to gradually substitute the current Brazilian taxation system. The Brazilian Tax Reform is expected to be implemented between 2026 and 2033.
*   **ANEEL:** Tension exists between ANEEL and the federal government, highlighting political interference in technical regulations. ANEEL has the prerogative of implementing policies, conducting auctions and concessions, managing contracts, establishing rules for the energy service, creating a methodology for calculating tariffs, supervising the supply of energy, and mediating conflicts between the operators and consumers.
*   **Power Distribution Concessions:** Starting in 2025, the contracts for 20 distribution concessions belonging to the second group—those companies privatized after 1995—will expire.
*   **Law No. 15,097/2025:** Implements the new regulation for offshore wind generation in Brazil.
*   **Provisional Measure No. 1,300/2025:** Issued by the Brazilian government to initiate a series of reforms within the electricity sector. The free contracting market for low voltage consumers will open as of August 1, 2026 (industrial and commercial consumers) and December 1, 2027 (residential consumers).

**4. Global Correlation:**

*   **China:** In 2024, Chinese investments in Brazil were strongly driven by the electricity and renewable energy sectors, with the electricity sector receiving US$1.43 billion, a 115% increase compared to 2023.
*   **US Fed Rates:** The FED's interest rate changes have an impact on the Brazilian real. When the FED raises interest rates, it strengthens the dollar against other currencies, including the real.
*   **US Tariffs:** Brazil's industrial output expanded by a meager 0.6 percent in 2025, under constant pressure from U.S. tariffs and a high annual benchmark interest rate of 15 percent. Exports to the United States dropped by 8.6 percent in the second half of 2025.
*   **Eurozone:** Maintaining the benchmark rate in the Eurozone tends to support the appreciation of the euro against the dollar, a movement that could weaken the dollar globally and indirectly favor the real.
