Okay, I will act as a Financial Auditor and Forensic Accountant and provide the financial data log for HGRU11 based on the most recent Quarterly Results (Earnings Release) and Management Guidance.

Based on the search results, it's difficult to extract the specific financial data for the last reported quarter vs. the same quarter last year (YoY) for HGRU11. The search results provide general information about HGRU11, including its dividend yield, technical analysis, and some discussion of recent events. However, they do not contain the hard financial data requested, such as Net Revenue, EBITDA, Net Income, Operating Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow, or management guidance.

**Financial Data Log (Incomplete)**

*   **Dividend Yield:** 13.48%
*   **Current Price:** R$ 125.35 (as of today, price has fallen −2.17% in the past 24 hours)
*   **Last dividend:** R$ 0.95 per quota on 02/26
*   **Dividend Yield:** 0.74% based on the R$ 129.05 quota price from 01/26
*   **Year-to-date performance:** Up 17.37%

I need access to the official earnings release document or management report to fulfill the request completely.
