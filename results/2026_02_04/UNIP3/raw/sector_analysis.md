Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Materials/Chemicals sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations. I will present the information in a bulleted list with specific data points, dates, or entity names, and avoid market commentary.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Materials/Chemicals sector in Brazil, based on the research objectives:

**1. Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Iron Ore:** Steel production is projected to decline to 32.4 million tonnes in 2026 due to intensified import competition. Consequently, iron ore price trends continue influencing Brazil’s industrial composition.
*   **Lithium:** Brazil's lithium production is projected to reach 63,757 metric tons in 2026, a 23% increase from 2025, following operational adjustments. However, this figure may be adjusted downward due to production issues.
*   **Crude Steel:** A 2.2% decline in crude steel production is expected in 2026, totaling 32,412 metric tons.

**2. Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **Selic Rate:** The Central Bank of Brazil has maintained the Selic rate at 15%. Representatives of industry have expressed concerns that this high rate stifles economic activity.
*   **Impact of Selic:** A Selic rate of 15% makes many construction projects unviable. The Brazilian Chamber of the Construction Industry (CBIC) reduced its 2025 growth projection for the sector from 2.3% to 1.3% due to the prolonged high interest rate cycle.
*   **Inflation:** The Central Bank of Brazil expects inflation to be at 4.0% for 2026 and 3.8% for 2027. Copom projects inflation at 3.2% by the third quarter of 2027.

**3. Regulatory Actions:**

*   **REIQ and Presiq:** Brazilian chemical and petrochemical industry associations are urging the government to address the 2026 gap in the Special Chemical Industry Regime (Reiq). Presidential vetoes affecting Reiq have created an "immediate and severe" impact on domestic producers. A new stimulus program called Presiq is being debated in parliament, which could replace REIQ.
*   **Import Tariffs:** In **October 2024**, the government increased import taxes on 30 chemical products. For polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), the rate increased to 20% from 12.6%.
*   **ANVISA:** On **February 10, 2025**, Brazil's Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) issued Resolution RDC No. 961/2025, amending RDC No. 56/2021, adding two chemicals to the positive list of substances for food contact plastics.
*   **Law 15.022/2024:** Law 15.022/2024 establishes the National Inventory of Chemical Substances. Manufacturers and importers of chemical substances will have to register their substances in the Inventory within a 3-year period from when the registering system becomes operational. The government has until **November 14, 2027**, to develop the system.
*   **ANP Resolution No. 852/2021:** On **September 24, 2021**, the Brazilian Agency for Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP) published Resolution No. 852/2021, establishing a new regulatory framework for producing petroleum products and natural gas, as well as covering storage, sale and third-party services.

**4. Global Correlation:**

*   **China:** Brazil's industry ministry has launched probes into alleged Chinese dumping of industrial products, including chemicals. Increased imports from China are posing challenges to the Brazilian chemical industry.
*   **US Tariffs:** The chemical sector is expected to be significantly affected by extra tariffs imposed by the US government on imports. In **2024**, the US accounted for 16% of Brazil's total chemical exports, or US$2.4 billion of the US$15.2 billion total.
*   **US Fed Rates:** External factors such as US economic conditions and global financial volatility continue to affect emerging markets.
*   **EU-Mercosur Agreement:** The EU-Mercosur trade agreement could strengthen Brazil's position as a strategic supplier of critical minerals to Europe.
*   **Global Economy:** The global economy in 2025 exceeded expectations despite the impact of US tariffs, which changed international trade. For 2026, a similar growth rate is expected, but with high risks due to the instability of US economic policy, uncertainties surrounding the Federal Reserve, and the geopolitical landscape.
