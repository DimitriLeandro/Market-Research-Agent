Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Industrial/Automotive sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural factors impacting the Industrial/Automotive sector in Brazil, as of February 4, 2026:

**Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Iron Ore:** Traded at $102.16 USD/T on February 4, 2026. The price has fallen 3.74% over the past month and is down 2.53% compared to the same time last year. Vale's iron ore fines prices fell to an average of $91.6/t last year from $95.3/t a year earlier.
*   **Brent Crude Oil:** Traded at $66.50 per barrel on February 4, 2026, up 0.30%. Some analysts predict oil prices to trade in the $55-$65 range through Q1 2026 due to oversupply and demand headwinds.
*   **Pulp (Kraft):** Rose to 5272 CNY/T on February 4, 2026, up 0.27% from the previous day. Over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 3.51%, and is down 14.42% compared to the same time last year. In December 2025, Brazil exported $947M of Wood pulp & paper scrap.
*   **CBIOs:** No specific current price data was found in the search results.

**Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **Selic Rate:** Brazil's central bank has kept its target interest rate stable at 15% since June 2025. On February 4, 2026, the Selic rate remains unchanged at 15.00%.
*   **IPCA (Inflation):** Brazil's headline inflation decelerated to an annual 4.26% in December. The 2026 inflation forecast was cut for the 5th consecutive week to 3.99%.

**Regulatory Actions:**

*   **Special Chemical Industry Regime (Reiq):** Brazilian chemical and petrochemical industry associations are urging the federal government to address the 2026 gap in Reiq, warning of plant shutdowns and job losses due to regulatory uncertainty.
*   **ANEEL:** ANEEL can regulate the maximum and minimum tariff prices for charging electric vehicles, to avoid divergences and abuses.
*   **Route 2030:** In November 2018, Brazil published regulations for “Route 2030,” which replaced the former Inovar-Auto Regime. The new regime focuses on creating incentives for the automotive industry by granting tax credits to companies that invest in research and development (R&D).

**Global Correlation:**

*   **China:** Chinese OEMs are expanding in the Brazilian automotive market, expected to encompass fifteen companies and capture over 9% market share by August 2025.
*   **US Fed Rates:** When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, US assets become more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real. This depreciation increases the cost of importing inputs and raises financing costs for Brazilian companies, reducing their investment capacity.
*   **US Tariffs:** The increase in trade barriers may affect Brazil’s attractiveness to global investors and the dynamics of Brazilian assets listed on stock exchanges.
*   **General:** The volatility of the Brazilian capital market is a natural consequence of its dependence on external factors.
