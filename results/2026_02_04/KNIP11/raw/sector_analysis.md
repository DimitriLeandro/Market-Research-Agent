Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Paper/Receivables sector in Brazil, focusing on the external environment and adhering to the specified constraints.

Here's an analysis of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Paper/Receivables sector in Brazil, based on the provided search results:

*   **Iron Ore Prices:**
    *   On February 4, 2026, Iron Ore traded flat at $102.16 USD/T. Over the past month, the price has fallen 3.74%, and it is down 2.53% compared to the same time last year.
    *   Vale forecasts iron ore prices to stabilize around $100/t in 2026. This is due to increased supply from large mining companies, the development of the Simandou deposit in Guinea, and a gradual decline in demand from China.
    *   Brazilian iron ore exports are expected to remain robust, exceeding 400 million tonnes by 2026.
    *   The average price of iron ore per ton closed 2025 at US$69.5, compared to US$76.8 in 2024.

*   **Brent Oil Prices:**
    *   On February 4, 2026, Brent rose to $67.52 USD/Bbl, up 0.28% from the previous day. Over the past month, Brent's price has risen 9.33%, but it is still 9.50% lower than a year ago.
    *   The EIA forecasts the Brent crude oil price will average $56 per barrel in 2026, 19% less than in 2025.
    *   J.P. Morgan Research lowered its Brent price forecast to $58/bbl for 2026.
    *   Fitch Ratings forecasts Brent at $65/bbl for 2026, reflecting oversupply from OPEC+ restorations and slowing global consumption growth amid energy transitions.

*   **Pulp Prices:**
    *   On February 4, 2026, Kraft Pulp rose to 5272 CNY/T, up 0.27% from the previous day. Over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 3.51%, and is down 14.42% compared to the same time last year.
    *   In Q1, pulp prices in Latin America plummeted by 18%, putting direct pressure on forestry sector operating income and overall profits.

*   **CBIO Prices:**
    *   I am unable to find information regarding CBIO prices.

*   **Interest Rates (Selic) and Inflation (IPCA):**
    *   On January 28, 2026, the Central Bank of Brazil kept the Selic rate at 15%, its highest level in nearly two decades.
    *   Minutes from the Central Bank's January 28 meeting indicate that policymakers emphasized the need to maintain restrictive interest rates until the disinflation process is consolidated and expectations align with targets.
    *   Annual inflation in Brazil reached 4.5% in the first half of January 2026. Central bankers project this rate will decrease to 3.2% by the third quarter of 2027.
    *   The high Selic rate of 15% is seen as stifling economic activity by the National Confederation of Industry (CNI).
    *   A Selic rate of 15% makes many construction projects unviable. In October 2025, the Brazilian Chamber of the Construction Industry (CBIC) reduced its 2025 growth projection for the sector from 2.3% to 1.3%, citing the impacts of the prolonged high interest rate cycle.

*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   On June 11, 2025, the Brazilian Government published Provisional Measure No. 1,303/2025, increasing the taxation of Interest on Net Equity (INE) payments from 15% to 20%, effective January 1, 2026.
    *   The measure introduces a 5% withholding tax on income from certain financial investments related to real estate and agribusiness, effective from January 1, 2026.
    *   The tax rate on online betting operations will increase from 12% to 18% starting October 1, 2025.
    *   Complementary Law No. 214/2025, sanctioned on January 16, 2025, establishes and regulates new consumption taxes in Brazil (Tax on Goods and Services — IBS; Contribution on Goods and Services — CBS; and Selective Tax — IS), with the transition starting on January 1, 2026.
    *   On November 26, 2025, the Brazilian government enacted Law No. 15,270/2025, introducing changes to the Individual Income Taxation, with the aim of expanding the exemption range and reducing the tax burden on low- and middle-income taxpayers, effective January 1, 2026.

*   **Global Correlation:**
    *   The US Federal Reserve maintained its benchmark interest rates at a range of 3.50% to 3.75% per year.
    *   China's expansion of integrated pulp and paper production is likely to reduce imports in the coming years, creating space for increased Brazilian exports to the United States.
    *   US President Donald Trump announced plans to impose a 50% tariff on all imports from Brazil, with the new policy slated to take effect August 1, 2025.
    *   Markets such as the US and China, which had restrictions, are reopening to Brazilian beef, poultry and pork. The US lifted tariffs on Brazilian beef by the end of the fourth quarter and China later cleared Brazil to resume poultry exports after restrictions were imposed in the second quarter.

*   **Paper Packaging Industry**
    *   The Brazilian packaging market is expected to reach approximately US$40.12 billion in 2026, driven by the expansion of e-commerce and the search for more sustainable solutions, such as paper and cardboard packaging.
    *   Studies indicate that the paper packaging segment maintains a consistent growth outlook in the coming years, with annual rates exceeding 5%, supported by the replacement of plastic packaging and increased logistics demand.
    *   Public policies aimed at reducing the use of plastic and strengthening circular economy practices have favored the adoption of paper-based packaging, especially in retail and e-commerce.
