Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Financials sector in Brazil, focusing on the external environment and adhering to the specified constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Financials sector in Brazil:

### Commodity/Input Prices

*   **Fuel Prices:** In Q4 2025, a reduction in fuel prices, particularly a near 5% cut in gasoline prices at refineries, helped contain current inflation and reinforce the disinflation process.

### Interest Rates & Inflation

*   **Selic Rate:** As of January 28, 2026, the Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) of the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB) voted to maintain the Selic rate unchanged at 15%. The BCB had gained independence from the Government by law in February 2021.
*   **Selic Rate Projections:** Market consensus anticipates 50 basis points of rate cuts in each of the next seven policy meetings in 2026, potentially bringing the Selic rate to 11.5% by year-end.
*   **Real Interest Rate:** Brazil currently has the highest real interest rate among emerging economies. With the Selic rate at 15% and annual inflation at 4.3%, real rates are at 10.7%.
*   **Inflation (IPCA):** Brazil's annual inflation rate eased to 4.26% in December 2025, down from 4.46% in November, marking the lowest reading since August 2024.
*   **Inflation Target:** The Copom acknowledged the reduction of inflation from 5.5% YoY in April 2025 to 4.3% YoY in December 2025, remaining within the upper end of the +/- 1.5% tolerance band around the 3% target.
*   **Inflation Expectations:** Inflation is expected to end 2026 at 3.4%. Economists surveyed by the central bank project inflation at 3.99% in 2026, 3.80% in 2027, and 3.50% in both 2028 and 2029.
*   **Impact of Selic Rate:** According to the National Confederation of Industry (CNI), the high Selic rate has made credit more expensive, reduced consumption, and weakened industrial activity.
*   **Brazilian Real:** On February 4, 2026, the Brazilian real hit a nine-month high, trading near 5.26 per US dollar, as investors positioned for interest rate cuts. The real has gained 8.6% over the past 12 months.

### Regulatory Actions

*   **BaaS Regulation:** Joint Resolution No. 16 of November 28, 2025, establishes the regulatory framework for banking-as-a-service (BaaS) in Brazil.
*   **Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs):** From February 2, 2026, VASPs are subject to a regulatory regime established by the BCB through Resolutions No. 519, 520 and 521, published on November 10, 2025.
*   **BCB Regulatory Priorities:** On April 24, 2025, the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) announced its list of regulatory priorities for 2025 and 2026, including the evolution of Open Finance, virtual asset regulations, monitoring artificial intelligence usage, and the expansion of Pix's functionalities.
*   **Taxation of Financial Operations:** On May 22, 2025, the Brazilian Federal Government published Decree 12.466/2025, significantly increasing tax rates on credit transactions (IOF-credit) and certain foreign exchange transactions (IOF-FX), effective from May 23, 2025.

### Global Correlation

*   **US Fed Rate Impact:** When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, US assets become more attractive, encouraging capital migration to developed economies and depreciating the Brazilian real. This depreciation increases the cost of importing inputs and raises financing costs for Brazilian companies, reducing their investment capacity.
*   **China's Stimulus:** Disappointment in China's stimulus package in October 2024 led to a downturn in the Brazilian stock market, Ibovespa.
*   **China's Shadow Banking:** As of September 2025, concerns existed regarding China's shadow banking system, which had reached 170% of GDP and could potentially impact Brazil.
*   **US Government Shutdown:** The possibility of a shutdown of public services in the US could intensify aversion to the dollar and stimulate portfolio diversification toward emerging markets, benefiting the real.
