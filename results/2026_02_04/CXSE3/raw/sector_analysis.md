Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Brazilian insurance sector, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural factors affecting the Brazilian insurance sector, as of February 4, 2026:

### Commodity/Input Prices

*   A divergence in commodity prices is occurring, with strong demand supporting metals and agricultural products, while excess supply is pressuring oil prices. This divergence will likely impact corporate earnings.
*   Favorable commodity prices have contributed to reducing industrial goods and food inflation.

### Interest Rates & Inflation

*   **Selic Rate:** On January 28, 2026, the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) maintained the Selic rate at 15.00%, its highest level in nearly two decades. However, the BCB has signaled that an easing cycle may begin in March 2026.
*   A signal to start the easing cycle in March 2026 in the Copom minutes tends to reduce the outlook for the Brazilian interest rate differential and weigh on the real.
*   **Inflation:** Annual inflation in Brazil reached 4.5% in the first half of January 2026. The BCB projects this rate will decrease to 3.2% by the third quarter of 2027.
*   Economists surveyed by the central bank expect interest rates to be nearly 15% in 2025.
*   The BCB's cautious monetary policy approach has contributed to disinflationary progress.
*   In December, Brazil's year-on-year industrial output fell short of projections by 0.4% at 1%.
*   January's inflation print of 4.4% YoY, makes a future rate hike very unlikely.

### Regulatory Actions

*   **New Insurance Contract Law (Law No. 15.040/2024):** This law, also referred to as the Brazilian Insurance Act, took effect on December 11, 2025. It revokes provisions of the Brazilian Civil Code that previously governed insurance contracts.
*   The new law introduces stricter timelines for insurer and reinsurer responses, improves claims transparency, and restricts unilateral policy cancellations.
*   Law No. 15.040/2024 limits the ability to apply foreign law and jurisdictions in insurance and reinsurance disputes.
*   The main objective of Law 15.040/2024 is to consolidate and modernize Brazil's insurance framework by unifying rules, reinforcing consumer protection, and clarifying market practices across all lines of insurance (except health).
*   **IOF Tax Changes:** In June 2025, the IOF rate on "foreign exchange transactions for the transfer of funds abroad" increased from 0.38% to 3.5%, affecting reinsurance premiums remitted to international reinsurers.
*   A 5% IOF rate will be levied if individual contributions to life insurance policies that include a survival benefit exceed BRL 600,000 in total annual contributions made to one or more insurance companies starting January 1, 2026.
*   **Complementary Law No. 213/2025:** This law, expected to come into effect from the end of 2025, grants insurance cooperatives greater operational freedom.
*   **BCB Instruction No. 701/2026:** This complements BCB Resolution No. 520/2025 and establishes requirements for independent technical certification for virtual asset service providers.
*   In 2023, the legislature approved the Statutory Framework on Guarantees (Marco Legal das Garantias) (Law 14.711/23), which fine-tuned the rules governing credit operations.

### Global Correlation

*   **US Tariffs:** US tariff policy is expected to slow global economic growth to 2.3% in 2025, down from 2.8% in 2024.
*   **China Stimulus:** China is likely to balance stimulus with reform in its 15th Five-Year Plan, considering debt sustainability and a 5% growth target.
*   China approved $7.2 Billion of insurance funds to be invested as long-term equity in China A-Shares.
*   **US Federal Reserve:** The US Federal Reserve ended a cycle of three cuts.
*   If US labor market indicators reinforce the reading of employment stability, the expectation that US interest rates will remain high for a prolonged period tends to consolidate, supporting Treasury yields and strengthening the dollar globally.
*   The possibility of a shutdown of public services in the US could intensify aversion to the dollar and stimulate portfolio diversification toward emerging markets, benefiting the real.
*   Maintaining the benchmark rate in the Eurozone tends to support the appreciation of the euro against the dollar, a movement that could weaken the dollar globally and indirectly favor the real.
*   The future trajectory of monetary policy will depend on some key factors, including the impact of German fiscal stimulus on growth, the evolution of the exchange rate especially after the euro's accumulated appreciation in the year, and the disinflationary effects associated with falling energy prices and a greater supply of Chinese goods at lower prices.
*   The intensification of tensions involving the US and Iran increases global risk aversion, favoring "safe-haven" assets and potentially hurting emerging market currencies, such as the real.
*   Global dynamics directly influence investments, making it essential for companies and investors to understand these impacts and adopt strategies to mitigate risks and seize opportunities in an environment of increasing economic complexity.
*   Foreign investors have increased their share of the financial volume traded on Brazil's main stock exchange (Brasil Bolsa Balcão, or B3) in 2024, reaching 55.8 percent, the highest level since 2019.
