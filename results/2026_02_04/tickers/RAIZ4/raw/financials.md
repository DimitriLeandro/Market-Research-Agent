Okay, I will perform a financial audit focusing on the latest available data for RAIZ4, extracting key financial metrics and trends. I will focus on revenue and income, margins, cash flow, and any available management guidance.

Here's a summary of RAIZ4's recent financial performance:

**1. Revenue & Income:**

*   **Q3 2024 (released Dec 31, 2024):** Revenue fell 8.28% to R$66.87 billion. The company reported a net loss of R$2.59 billion.
*   **Q1 2025:** Revenue per Share was R$5.25. Net Income per Share was -R$0.18.
*   **Q2 2025 (Fiscal Q2 2026 ended 9/30/25):** Revenue was 59.91B BRL, a year-over-year decrease of 17.83%. Net income was -2.32B BRL.
*   **Q3 2024 (Third Quarter and Nine Months Ended December 31, 2024):** Net loss was BRL 2,590.48 million compared to net income of BRL 779.2 million a year ago.
*   **Revenue Growth:** A video from May 14, 2025, mentions that in Q1 2025, revenue grew 7.5% to R$57 billion. However, the company struggles to convert revenue into profitability due to high operational costs, interest expenses, and investments.
*   **Q4 2024:** The company's revenue moved from 54,217.56 in the previous quarter to 59,910.62 in the latest quarter, and net income moved from -1,846.24 to -2,321.07 compared to the previous quarter.

**YoY and QoQ Trends:** Revenue figures show fluctuations. While there was a reported increase in Q1 2025, Q2 2025 shows a significant YoY decrease. Net income has generally been negative, with substantial losses reported in recent quarters.

**2. Margins:**

*   **Q3 2024:** Gross revenue ended at R$2.91 billion with a profit margin of 4.35%. The result after financial and other costs ended at -R$2.59 billion, giving a negative profit margin of -3.87%.
*   **TTM Gross Margin:** 4.03%.
*   **TTM Net Profit Margin:** -3.89%.
*   **Net Profit Margin (Fiscal Q2 2026 ended 9/30/25):** -3.87, a -1,448.00% change Y/Y.

**3. Cash Flow:**

*   **Q1 2025:** Free Cash Flow per Share: -R$1.12.
*   **Q2 2025:** Free cash flow is -2.82 BRL.
*   **2024:** Free cash flow was -7.79 B BRL and operating cash flow was 3.67 B BRL.
*   **Levered Free Cash Flow (latest quarter):** -2,797.13, reflecting a 76.93% change from the previous quarter.
*   **Free Cash Flow Yield (most recent quarter):** -13.95%.

**FCF Generation vs Net Income:** RAIZ4's free cash flow has been significantly lower than its net income, and often negative, indicating challenges in converting earnings to cash.

**4. Guidance:**

*   **Operational Plan for 2025'26 Crop Year (starting April 1, 2025):**
    *   Efficiency Gains: Reduction and optimization of corporate and operational structures, generating an estimated benefit of approximately R$ 500 million for the year (nominal terms), positively impacting segment EBITDA.
    *   Crushing: Estimated between 72 and 75 million tons of sugarcane.
    *   Mix: Improvement in sugarcane quality, enabling increased sugar production, with an estimated production mix between 52% and 54%, capturing greater profitability.
    *   Trading: Redefined scope of operations to maximize the value of own sugar and the integrated positioning in the ethanol value chain, reducing working capital requirements, result volatility, and risk exposure.
*   **CAPEX Guidance for 2025'26 (R$ Million):**
    *   Consolidated CAPEX: Between 9,000 and 9,800.
    *   Recurring: Between 7,000 and 7,500.
    *   Expansion/Projects: Between 2,000 and 2,300.

**Additional Points:**

*   **EBITDA:** Raizen reported BRL1.89B in EBITDA for its fiscal quarter ending in June of 2025. The company's annual EBITDA is $11.18B.
*   **Debt:** High leverage remains a concern. JPMorgan estimates leverage at 4.0x by Q4 2026.
*   **Fitch Downgrade:** Fitch Ratings downgraded Raizen to 'BBB-' from 'BBB' in October 2025.
*   **JPMorgan Analysis (Dec 2025):** JPMorgan has a neutral recommendation for Raízen, noting that its performance depends on factors like capitalizations and M&A activity. They project weaker prices for sugar and ethanol.
*   **Penny Stock:** Raízen became a penny stock, prompting B3 to request a plan to elevate the stock price.
*   **Cost Reduction:** Raízen is undergoing operational restructuring expected to generate over R$500 million in annual expense savings.

**Upcoming Earnings Release:**

*   Q3 25'26 Earnings Release: February 11, 2026.

This data paints a picture of a company with significant revenue but struggling profitability, high debt, and ongoing restructuring efforts.
