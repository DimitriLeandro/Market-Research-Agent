Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Utilities/Energy sector in Brazil, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers impacting the Utilities/Energy sector in Brazil, based on the research objectives:

*   **Commodity/Input Prices:**
    *   **Iron Ore:** Increased to $100.77 USD/T, the highest since April 2025. Over the past 4 weeks, it gained 4.67%, but decreased 4.26% in the last 12 months.
    *   **Brent Oil:** No specific recent price data available in the search results, but generally, correlations between CBIO prices and Brent oil prices are weak.
    *   **Pulp Prices:** Kraft Pulp rose to 5272 CNY/T on February 4, 2026, up 0.27% from the previous day. Over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 3.51%, and is down 14.42% compared to the same time last year. Wood costs for pulpmills in Brazil doubled in two years in US dollar terms as of 2023.
    *   **CBIOs (Decarbonization Credits):** Average CBIO trading prices were at their lowest levels since 2022 as of June 16, 2025, averaging R$59.30 ($10.70) on May 13, 2025. However, by October 2024, prices rose by 17% over two weeks to R$91 ($16), the highest level since May 2024. In February 2024, CBIOs reached a record high of R$104.50, 93.4% above the historical average.

*   **Interest Rates & Inflation:**
    *   **Selic Rate:** The Central Bank of Brazil (Copom) maintained the Selic rate at 15.00% per year as of February 2, 2026. There are divided expectations regarding a potential rate cut in the March meeting, with some anticipating a 0.25% or 0.50% reduction. A lower Selic rate can make solar financing more attractive but may also reduce foreign capital inflow, potentially devaluing the Real and increasing equipment costs.
    *   **IPCA (Inflation):** In October 2023, energy inflation reached 8.59%, compared to an overall inflation rate of 4.82%. Residential electricity prices were up 10.6% year-over-year. In September 2025, high electricity prices drove inflation, with residential electricity prices up 10.6% from a year earlier.

*   **Regulatory Actions:**
    *   **Tax Reform:** Complementary Law No. 214/2025 instituted a dual VAT model (CBS and IBS) to replace the existing taxation system, expected to be implemented between 2026 and 2033.
    *   **New Gas Law:** Law No. 14,134/2021 modernizes the legal framework for the natural gas sector.
    *   **Power Distribution Concessions:** Draft decree increases requirements for quality of service and financial health for extending electricity distribution concessions.
    *   **Renewable Energy Incentives:** Law No. 14,902/2024 created the Green Mobility and Innovation Program (MOVER), combining financial and tax incentives for energy efficiency.
    *   **ANEEL's Role:** ANEEL regulates the power sector, oversees auctions, manages contracts, establishes rules, and sets tariffs.
    *   **Biofuel Blending Mandate:** Since December 2023, only domestically produced biodiesel has been allowed for meeting Brazil's biofuel blending mandate.

*   **Global Correlation:**
    *   **US Fed Rate:** When the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, the dollar strengthens, potentially depreciating the Brazilian Real, increasing import costs, and raising financing costs for Brazilian companies.
    *   **China's Economy:** A slowing economy in China could decrease import volumes of Brazilian pulp.
    *   **US Trade Policies:** New tariffs imposed by the US can affect Brazil's capital markets.
    *   **US Low-Carbon Fuel Tax Credit:** The US Department of Treasury released a proposal clarifying eligibility for the "45Z" tax credit, which kicked off in 2025.
