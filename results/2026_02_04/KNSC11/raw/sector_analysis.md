Okay, I will provide a macroeconomic and structural analysis of the Brazilian Paper/Hedge sector, focusing on commodity/input prices, interest rates & inflation, regulatory actions, and global correlations.

Here's a breakdown of the macroeconomic and structural drivers affecting the Brazilian Paper/Hedge sector, as of February 4, 2026:

**Commodity/Input Prices:**

*   **Iron Ore:** On February 4, 2026, Iron Ore traded at $102.16 USD/T. Over the past month, the price has fallen 3.74%, and it is down 2.53% compared to the same time last year. Vale forecasts iron ore prices to stabilize around $100/t in 2026.
*   **Brent Oil:** On February 4, 2026, Brent Crude rose to $67.52 USD/Bbl, up 0.28% from the previous day. Over the past month, Brent's price has risen 9.33%, but it is still 9.50% lower than a year ago. The EIA forecasts Brent Crude to average $55.87 per barrel in 2026.
*   **Pulp:** Kraft Pulp rose to 5272 CNY/T on February 4, 2026, up 0.27% from the previous day. Over the past month, Kraft Pulp's price has fallen 3.51%, and is down 14.42% compared to the same time last year. On January 28, 2026, Suzano announced it would increase pulp prices by up to $30 per ton in February. In 2023, Brazil's export of chemical wood pulp plummeted to $7.2B.
*   **CBIOs (Decarbonization Credits):** For 2026, the overall target has been set at 48.09 million CBIOs, equivalent to a reduction of 48.09 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. A Procuradoria-Geral da República (PGR) parecer (opinion) may elevate CBIO prices in 2026.

**Interest Rates & Inflation:**

*   **Selic Rate:** On February 3, 2026, Brazil's central bank maintained the Selic rate at 15%, its highest level in nearly two decades.
*   **Inflation (IPCA):** Annual inflation in Brazil reached 4.5% in the first half of January. Central bankers project this rate will decrease to 3.2% by the third quarter of 2027. High interest rates are seen as an obstacle to short-term credit by 80% of industrial companies, and to long-term financing by 71%.

**Regulatory Actions:**

*   **ANEEL (Electricity):** ANEEL established 91 activities for its regulatory agenda for the 2026–2027 biennium, addressing topics such as curtailment, energy storage, extreme climate events, and market opening. ANEEL will include regulation for the use of energy storage in electricity transmission and distribution, and in consumption during its next review of regulations, for the 2025 and 2026 period.
*   **ANP (Oil, Natural Gas and Biofuels):** ANP updated the methodology for calculating the WACC for the next regulatory cycle, which will govern returns on regulated investments from 2026 to 2030. The overall target for 2026 has been set at 48.09 million CBIOs, equivalent to a reduction of 48.09 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.
*   **Central Bank:** On April 24, 2025, the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) announced its list of regulatory priorities for 2025 and 2026, including the evolution of Open Finance, virtual asset regulations, monitoring artificial intelligence usage, and the expansion of Pix's functionalities. The Central Bank of Brazil issued three resolutions (BCB Nos. 519, 520 and 521) on November 10, 2025, establishing a regulatory framework for virtual asset services, effective February 2, 2026.

**Global Correlation:**

*   **China:** China is expected to adopt stimulus measures for its economy, boosting iron ore demand. China bought about 4.97 million tonnes of wood pulp exported by Brazil in the first eight months of this year, becoming the biggest buyer of such exports in that period.
*   **US Fed Rates:** When the FED raises interest rates, it strengthens the dollar against other currencies, including the real. On July 9, 2025, the US President announced plans to impose a 50% tariff on all imports from Brazil, with the new policy slated to take effect August 1, 2025.
