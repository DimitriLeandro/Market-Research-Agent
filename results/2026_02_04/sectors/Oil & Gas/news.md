Okay, I will compile a chronological list of recent news and events affecting the Oil & Gas sector in Brazil, focusing on M&A activity, legislation, global events impacting the sector, and supply chain disruptions.

Here's a chronological summary of recent news and events impacting the Brazilian Oil & Gas sector:

**October 20, 2025:** Brazil's environmental agency Ibama approved Petrobras to drill an exploratory well in Block FZA-M-59, off the mouth of the Amazon. This decision was met with criticism from environmental groups, who viewed it as undermining Brazil's credibility and the agenda of COP30, which was held in Belém.

**December 2025:** Brazil's combined oil and gas production reached a record monthly high of 5.237 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Crude oil output exceeded 4 million barrels per day, and natural gas production approached 195 million cubic meters per day. Pre-salt output accounted for almost 80% of national production, with a year-on-year gain of over 19%.

**December 15, 2025:** China's growing presence in Brazil's oil sector demonstrates an ambitious and carefully planned strategy.

**December 23, 2025:** The mining, energy, and infrastructure segments in Brazil are expected to generate major M&A deals throughout 2026, with optimistic expectations and growing investor interest. However, overall M&A activity in the country is expected to remain stable.

**January 5, 2026:** Brazil's energy sector is attracting substantial Chinese investment, with approximately 70% of Chinese FDI concentrated in sustainability and green energy. Access to Chinese renewable technology at competitive prices accelerates Brazil's low-carbon transition without abandoning economically valuable oil production.

**January 15, 2026:** Driven by large-scale transactions in the energy and natural resources sector, Brazil's mergers and acquisitions market moved more than US$ 58 billion in 2025.

**January 26, 2026:** Brazilian chemical and petrochemical industry associations are urging the federal government to deliver a rapid fix for the 2026 gap in the Special Chemical Industry Regime (Reiq), warning that regulatory uncertainty is accelerating plant shutdowns and job losses across key production hubs.

**January 28, 2026:** Global markets are expected to be oversupplied in the coming years, and production is set to expand again in 2026, with the United States and Brazil leading the charge.

**January 29, 2026:** A group of Brazilian organizations is seeking a fossil fuel phase-out, which includes fully banning hydraulic fracturing, gradually reducing natural gas and oil usage in industry, discontinuing investments in carbon capture and storage projects, and ending crude block auctions.

**January 29, 2026:** China's crude oil imports hit a record-high 11.6 million barrels per day in 2025, spurred by geopolitical tensions, low oil prices, and global oversupply, leading to increased stockpiles. Brazil's increasing production and China's view of the country as a reliable supplier likely contributed to the 28 percent increase in Brazil's exports to China.

**February 2, 2026:** Natural gas production in 2025 reached an annual average of 179 million cubic meters per day (Mm³/d), a historic record. The 4.9Mboe/d extracted in 2025 represented an increase of 12.7% compared to the previous record, reached in 2023, of 4.3Mboe/d. ANP projects that the average extracted volume in 2026 will be around 5.5Mboe/d, with 4.2Mb/d of oil and 210.3Mm³/d of natural gas.

**February 2, 2026:** Russian exports of diesel have surged, leading to increased imports by Brazil and potentially pressuring prices.

**February 4, 2026:** Brazil's Chamber of Deputies approved Legislative Decree Project (PDL) 167/25, ratifying key updates to the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (CLC/69). The move aligns Brazilian legislation with the latest International Maritime Organization (IMO) protocols, significantly raising compensation limits and expanding jurisdiction for tanker-related pollution incidents.

**February 4, 2026:** Shell Brasil Petróleo agreed to sell a 20% interest in the Orca project to Energy Development Corporation (EDC). The completion of the transaction is expected by the end of 2026.

**February 4, 2026:** Rystad Energy indicated that Argentina, Guyana, and Brazil are poised to drive oil production growth in South America for years to come. Investment in Latin America's oil industry is expected to increase in 2026, led by Brazil.

**February 4, 2026:** Brazil reached a historic milestone in oil and natural gas production in 2025, recording its highest annual output ever as energy extraction continued to accelerate across offshore fields.

**Ongoing Trends:**

*   **M&A Activity:** The oil and gas sector experienced consolidation in 2025, and M&A activity is expected to remain in the spotlight in 2026.
*   **Chinese Investment:** China continues to invest heavily in Brazil's energy sector, particularly in sustainability and green energy.
*   **Production Growth:** Brazil's oil and gas production continues to grow, driven by pre-salt reserves.
*   **Regulatory Uncertainty:** Uncertainty surrounding the Special Chemical Industry Regime (Reiq) is causing concern in the petrochemical industry.
*   **Global Oversupply:** Global markets are expected to be oversupplied with oil in 2026, which could put downward pressure on prices.
*   **Shift to Renewables:** Brazil is expanding its biofuels industry, with new E2G ethanol plants being developed across the country.
