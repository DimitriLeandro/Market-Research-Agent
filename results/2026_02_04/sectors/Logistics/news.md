Okay, I will compile a chronological list of recent news and events affecting the Logistics sector in Brazil, focusing on M&A activity, legislation, global events impacting the sector, and supply chain disruptions.

Here's a chronological overview of recent events impacting the Logistics sector in Brazil:

**2025**

*   **2025-03:** Logistical bottlenecks caused Brazil to fail to ship 637,767 bags of coffee, resulting in a $1.568 million loss. 55% of vessels experienced delays or schedule alterations at Brazil's main ports. The average container dwell time exceeded 40 hours, reaching up to 10 days at the Port of Santos.
*   **2025-05-14:** According to the CEO of MTM Logix, Brazilian ports are operating at full capacity due to outdated equipment, lack of maintenance, and underinvestment, creating an unsustainable situation.
*   **2025-05-15:** Brazil has seen the fastest growth in ocean-bound freight, even surpassing Mexico. This is partly due to the rise in EV exports from China to Brazil and the shift in trade lanes, with new direct routes established between China and countries like Chile and Peru.
*   **2025-07-03:** The volume of M&A transactions in Brazil grew by 40% between January and June compared to the same period in 2024, reaching USD 29 billion. However, the number of deals fell by 25%, from 432 to 322 transactions. The increase in deal value is attributed to a greater share of large-scale operations, mainly concentrated in the energy and natural resources sectors.
*   **2025-07-31:** Deteriorating port infrastructure in Brazil has become a critical obstacle for the country's agribusiness sector. Brazil invested only 2.2% of its GDP in infrastructure in 2024, while nearly double that (around 4.3%) would be required to meet projected demand over the next three decades.
*   **2025-08-19:** China's new $285 million export terminal in Brazil threatens billions of dollars in revenue for U.S. farmers.
*   **2025-10:** Brazil's president issued Decree No. 12,688, which established mandatory reverse logistics systems for plastic packaging and implemented regulations surrounding the minimum amount of recycled content that must be present within new plastic packaging.
*   **2025-11-03:** Brazil introduced legislation requiring companies to participate in a reverse logistics system for plastics packaging from January 2026. Decree Number 12,688 requires market operators to meet a recycled content target of 22% and a recovery rate of 32% in 2026.
*   **2025-11-04:** The Brazilian mergers and acquisitions (M&A) market experienced a robust rebound in 2025. Brazil recorded about 1,142 transactions totaling roughly BRL 187.8 billion through August 2025—a 33% increase versus the same period in 2024.

**2026**

*   **2026-01-05:** The Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change published Ordinances GM/MMA No. 1,560 and No. 1,561, bringing relevant updates to reverse logistics systems for electronic products and packaging in general. The rules maintain targets, expand the scope of materials, and detail procedures for the accreditation of entities and verifiers.
*   **2026-01-08:** Brazil freight and logistics market size in 2026 is estimated at USD 116.42 billion, growing from 2025 value of USD 111.11 billion with 2031 projections showing USD 147.06 billion, growing at 4.78% CAGR over 2026-2031.
*   **2026-01-16:** New legislation came into effect in Brazil, mandating the minimum proportion of recycled content in plastic packaging and the formation of reverse logistics systems to recover and recycle plastic packaging.
*   **2026-01-23:** Infra S.A launched a public consultation to update some of the rules associated with environmental licensing applicable to major works.
*   **2026-02-02:** China is flooding Latin American markets with low-priced exports, particularly cars and e-commerce goods. Brazil recorded a trade surplus of about $29 billion with China last year, partly due to surging soya exports.

**Ongoing Trends & Systemic Issues:**

*   **M&A Activity:** The Brazilian M&A market is experiencing growth and consolidation, driven by strategic positioning in the domestic market. Technology, renewable energy, healthcare, agribusiness, and infrastructure are key sectors driving growth.
*   **Supply Chain Disruptions:** Global supply chain disruptions, exacerbated by events like COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war, are generating inflationary pressures and forcing companies to look for local solutions.
*   **Port Infrastructure:** Deteriorating port infrastructure and systemic inefficiencies are impacting key supply chains, particularly for agribusiness. Underinvestment in infrastructure is a major concern.
*   **Reverse Logistics:** New legislation is pushing for reverse logistics systems, particularly for plastic packaging, with mandatory targets for recycled content and recovery rates.
*   **China's Influence:** China's growing trade and investment in Brazil are reshaping the logistics landscape, with increased exports to Brazil and investments in infrastructure like ports. The U.S.-China trade war is creating opportunities for Brazilian exports to Asia.
*   **Market Growth:** The Brazil third-party logistics market demonstrates strong growth prospects, driven by sustained e-commerce expansion, manufacturing sector recovery, and continued infrastructure modernization.
*   **Challenges:** Brazil's logistics sector faces challenges including vast territory, complex infrastructure, regulatory issues, cargo theft, and high logistics costs.
