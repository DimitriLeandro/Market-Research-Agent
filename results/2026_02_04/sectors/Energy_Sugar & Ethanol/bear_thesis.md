Okay, I'm ready to analyze the negative risks for the Brazilian Energy/Sugar & Ethanol sector and construct a bear case. Here are the search queries I'll use to gather the necessary information:

Here's a Bear Case analysis for the Brazilian Energy/Sugar & Ethanol sector, focusing on negative risks:

### **1. Structural Risks: Threats to Long-Term Viability**

*   **Oversupply Risks:** Brazil's flexible production capabilities in both sugar and ethanol can lead to oversupply in global markets, especially with the 2025/26 sugar crop projected at 44.5 MMT. Even small production adjustments can exacerbate these risks, impacting prices.
*   **Climate Change Impacts:** Droughts and heat waves are already impacting sugarcane yields, with Conab revising estimates downward by 3.1% due to climate stressors. Rising temperatures also pose a threat to workers, with increasing reports of heat-related illnesses and even deaths on sugarcane plantations.
*   **Labor Abuses:** Reports of slave-like working conditions on sugar plantations continue to surface, potentially leading to reputational damage and supply chain disruptions. Approximately 8,000 people have been found working in these conditions since 1995.
*   **Land Use Concerns:** Expansion of sugarcane production often occurs at the expense of other crops and forests. A study found that 92% of new ethanol production comes from new sugarcane areas, with 20% of these areas originally forests, implying deforestation.

### 2. Macro Headwinds

*   **Falling Sugar and Ethanol Prices:** After a period of high profitability, sugar and ethanol prices are falling, squeezing margins for Brazilian mills. International sugar prices have fallen approximately 28% over the past year, reaching around 14 cents a pound, which barely covers production costs.
*   **High Interest Rates:** Brazil's historically high interest rates increase the financial costs for refineries and reduce incentives for farmers to take credit.
*   **Inflation:** While not explicitly quantified in the search results, general inflationary pressures can impact the cost of inputs (fertilizers, fuel, labor) and erode profit margins.
*   **Ethanol Export Contraction:** Brazilian ethanol exports have contracted. In 2025, exports were around 1.7 billion liters, a 9% drop from 2024. The decline is due to strong domestic demand and low inventories, limiting exportable supply. In value terms, ethanol exports totaled US$ 976.6 million in 2025, down 8% from US$ 1.13 billion in 2024.

### 3. Regulatory Threats

*   **Tax Changes:** Changes in fuel taxes can significantly impact ethanol prices and the sugar/ethanol arbitrage for mills. Proposals to reduce or alter the ICMS tax on fuels can create uncertainty and volatility.
*   **Environmental Regulations:** Stricter environmental regulations regarding land use, water consumption, and burning practices could increase compliance costs for mills.
*   **Fuel of the Future Program:** While intended to boost ethanol demand, the government's Fuel of the Future program, which raised gasoline blending mandates to 30% as of August 1, 2025, has shifted demand toward anhydrous ethanol, potentially reducing hydrous ethanol supply by 1.2 billion liters.
*   **EU-Mercosur Trade Agreement:** While potentially beneficial, the EU-Mercosur trade agreement also introduces competitive pressures by expanding quotas for sugar and ethanol imports into the EU.

### 4. Competition

*   **Corn Ethanol:** The rise of corn-based ethanol production in Brazil is a major competitive threat. Corn ethanol now accounts for 22% of Brazil's total ethanol output. Increased corn ethanol production can lead sugarcane mills to divert production to sugar, even if prices are low. Rabobank projects more than 3 billion liters of additional corn ethanol capacity will come online in 2026.
*   **Falling Gasoline Prices:** Falling oil prices intensify competition between ethanol and gasoline, potentially limiting price increases for biofuel.
*   **Slow Hedging:** Sugarcane producers in Brazil have been slow to hedge for the 2026/27 season, with only a little more than 20% of anticipated raw sugar sales hedged, compared to over 40% last year and nearly 70% two years earlier. This leaves them vulnerable to price fluctuations.

### Conclusion

The Brazilian Energy/Sugar & Ethanol sector faces a complex and challenging landscape. Oversupply risks, climate change, regulatory uncertainty, and increasing competition from corn ethanol all contribute to a potentially negative outlook. A combination of these factors could significantly impact the profitability and long-term viability of the sector.
