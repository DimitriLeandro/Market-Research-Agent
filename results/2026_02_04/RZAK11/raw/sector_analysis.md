*   **Global Correlation:**

    *   2026 will probably see a slowdown in investments in recycling infrastructure such as new MRFs.

    *   Structural declines in traditional Graphic Paper grades will continue.
    *   The introduction of regulations, such as the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), will increasingly influence material sourcing and compliance costs throughout 2026, impacting price stability.
